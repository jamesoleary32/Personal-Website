# Chapter 1: Vertical Binding 

### My main takeaway
I am reading this proximate to the time in which i have read Manuel De Landa's works on neomaterialist ontology, what strikes me are some of points of similarity between their works - although I believe I discovered them independently. Serres' is a philosopher of science and history, the departure point of this book is the abstract universal nature of mathematics,

The introduction to mathemtical abstraction motivated the belief in a virtual world. The virtual world doesn't submit to our laws on the contrary we obey it's laws. 
To claim that our essence as humans reside in our manipulation of the virtual world. 
Once our animals began to paint animals and signs on cave walls - which is to say - invented representation (a term indictating the difference between absence and presence)

Culture takes over from nature by means of a sort of exo-Darwinism in which mutations and selections occur more rapidly & with greater adaptive capacity than biological evolution itself. 

#### The Other World 
Comparing various virtual worlds. 

#### Building a Barrier 
The romans surrounded the place where lightning strucl with a low wall of stone and bronze known as a *puteal* for its resemblance to a well head. This puteal marked the spot where heaven and earth came together. 

#### The Sun's Fire in the Pyramid 
Thales is said to have invented his theorem by comparing the shadow cast by one of the three great pyramids of Egypt with the one cast at the same hour by a man. 

The theory of the **homothetic forms** which is to say figures of the same form on different scales. 

Pyramid means *fire in the middle* in Greek 

#### Water & Fire Again 
Archimedes used mirrors to set fire to the Roman flet beseiging Syracuse in 3rd Century BCE. *Information is returned to energy, energy assumes the form of violence*.

#### Mathematical Physics
The genius of Gallileo, was not to establish the reality of heliocentrism, but instead to do with the connection between mathematics and the experiment - creating the link between a formal virtual world and the world of our perception. 

Scientific discovery creates a direct link between a precise locality in the realm of mathematics and a definite phenomenon of the real world. 

#### Two Myths
Midas, King of Phyrgia, was said to have receieved from Dionysus the power of transforming everything into gold - this manifested as a curse, and in order to rid of himself of this ability he was ordered to cleanse himself at the source of the river Patolus, in the neighbouring country of Lydia. Following this the river carried off nuggets of gold forming the rich alluvial deposits for which it was known in ancient times. 



#### A First Thunderbold 
Money appeared in Lydia for the first time ~7th Century BCE. 

#### Return to the present
Political life today has broken down because we no longer have a philosophy of history. Until relatively recently, politics was founded on a philosophy of the enlightenment, a Voltairean way of rereading St. John the Apostle. Adam Smith and Karl Marx. We are witnessing the extinction of these two opposed tendencies. 

#### Secular equivalent of the epiphany

The Greek miracle - an abstraction without a God.
