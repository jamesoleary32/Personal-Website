# Notes from *Pieces of the Action* by Vannevar Bush

## Key Chapters and Themes

### **Of Organisations**
- **Organisational Design**:
  - Research labs require different structures compared to combat regiments.
  - Military organisations:
    - Pyramidal with clear communication lines.
    - Goal: Ensure decisions are promptly made, and no commander is overburdened.

- **Historical Examples**:
  - **Battle of Leyte Gulf (1944)**:
    - Two independent commands (MacArthur and Nimitz) coordinated by the Joint Chiefs in Washington.
  - **Normandy Campaign**:
    - Supreme command held by Eisenhower ensured seamless operations.

- **Essence of Military Organisations**:
  - Tight, disciplined structures promote efficiency but hinder innovation.
  - Effective innovation requires collaboration with external organisations with loose structures.

- **National Defense Research Committee (NDRC)**:
  - Established pre-WWII to develop weapons for military use.
  - Integrated into the Office of Scientific Research and Development (OSRD), reporting directly to the President.
  - Operated with functional independence, strong backing, and direct funding from Congress.
  - Key Figures:
    - **Frank Jewett**: Grew Bell Labs, President of NAS.
    - **Oscar Cox**: Architect of Lend-Lease.

- **OSRD Structure**:
  - Pyramidal organisation:
    - Divisions and sections handled specific issues.
    - Contracts were made with universities, not individuals.
  - Subdivisions included:
    - **Engineering & Transition Office**: Facilitated production.
    - **Office of Field Service (OFS)**: Enabled military use of new tools/weapons.

- **Military Learning and Innovation**:
  - Collaboration between scientists and military officers:
    - Scientists provided abstract, practical solutions.
    - Officers offered loyalty and system discipline.
  - **Proximity Fuse**: A major technical achievement, comparable to radar and the atomic bomb.

---

### **Of Stumbling Blocks**
- **Complex Societies**:
  - Greater complexity increases the chance of systems breaking down.

- **Civilian-Military Collaboration**:
  - Barriers between civilian and military efforts can serve as protection against interference from inexperienced or overconfident parties.

---

### **Of Tyros**
- **Definition**: Tyro (Latin): A new recruit.
  - Tyros disrupt authority and channels of command.
  - Example: Pyke’s ice island idea, presented to Lord Mountbatten and later Churchill.

- **Key Observations**:
  - Tyros are more common in civilian contexts.
  - Overlapping commands, as seen in the **Battle of Leyte Gulf**, created operational inefficiencies.
  - Outdated belief structures in changing contexts also classify individuals as Tyros.

- **Examples**:
  - Truman-MacArthur confrontation: A near-insurrection.
  - OSRD: Civilian scientists and engineers learned to adapt to military systems effectively.

---

### **Of Teachers and Teaching**
- **Education System Challenges**:
  - Ambition distorted by social structures:
    - Over-educating youth for leadership roles in an upper class that is often unattainable.
  - Frustration among those unable to fit into artificially defined cultural roles.

---

### **Of Energies, Engines, and Hobbies**
- **Post-War Interests**:
  - Bush explored the pharmaceutical industry, engines, and investment management.
  - Criticism of the automobile industry for lack of innovation.

- **The Steam Engine**:
  - Advocated for steam engines over internal combustion engines:
    - Steam engines: Quiet, efficient, suitable for varied speeds.
    - Internal combustion engines: Designed for constant speed.
  - Steam engines fell out of favor due to:
    - Lack of vigorous development (e.g., Stanleys).
    - Restrictive laws requiring licensed engineers for operation.

## Key Concepts

### **Innovation Pipeline**
- **Tripartite Model**:
  1. **Basic Research** → 2. **Applied Research** → 3. **Development** → 4. **Production & Operations**.
- Vannevar Bush is regarded as the conceptual architect of this innovation model.

## Notable Links and Context
- Comparisons with other works:
  - **De Landa**: *War in the Age of Intelligent Machines*.
  - **Mirowski**: *Privatisation of American Science*.

## Reflections on the American Science Regime
1. The importance of **functional independence** in innovation:
   - OSRD’s success highlights the need for direct funding and operational autonomy.
2. Collaboration between **civilians and the military**:
   - Effective innovation during wartime required mutual learning and respect.
3. Challenges of **maintaining balance** between tight structures (military discipline) and looser systems (fostering creativity).
4. The **historical trajectory** of scientific and industrial progress:
   - Shows the interplay between organisational structures, technological advancements, and social systems.
