### Notes to integrate
  -  **[Thermodynamics in closed vs open systems](../notes/Thermodynamics_in_closed_vs_open_systems)** 
  -  **[Information theory as a theory of difference](../notes/Information_theory_as_a_theory_of_difference)**
  -  **[Foundations of a General Systems Theory](../notes/Foundations_of_a_General_Systems_Theory)** 
  -  **[System-to-system relations](../notes/System-to-system_relations)** 
  -  **[Observation problem in systems](../notes/Observation_problem_in_systems)** 

## **Lecture 1: General Sociological Theory**
- **Central Questions**:
  1. How is social order possible?
  2. What conditions are required for the persistence of a social system or society?
  3. What minimal conditions must be met for societal maintenance and problem-solving?

- **Core Ideas**:
  - Systems theory seeks to **bridge sociological dichotomies**, offering a form of **structural functionalism**.
  - Focus on integrating challenges like:
    - Deviance.
    - Limitations of social control.
    - Value contradictions.

- **Action as System**:
  - Connection between system formation (macro structures) and actions (basal operations).
  - Builds on **Parsons’ 2x2 matrix**, known for being MECE (Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive).

- **Parsons' Theory of Action**:
  - Actions as an **emergent property of reality**.
  - Components of action:
    1. **Ends and Means**: Differentiation between goals and tools to achieve them.
    2. **Values**: Societal constraints that limit choices in combining means and ends.

- **Key Distinction**:
  - **Theory of Action**: Oriented towards individual subjects.
  - **Systems Theory**: Abstract framework better suited for depicting macro-structures.

## **Lecture 3: The Theory of Open Systems**
- **Interdisciplinary Approach**:
  - Systems thinking conceptualized as interdisciplinary.
  - Draws on models from various fields, such as mathematics, physics, and economics.

- **Equilibrium Models**:
  - Early systems theory rooted in concepts of **stability and disturbance**:
    - **Equilibrium**: A state marking a system’s sensitivity to disturbance.
    - **Disequilibrium**: May be necessary for long-term stability.
  - Examples:
    - Economics (17th century): "Balance of trade" or "balance of power."
  
- **Thermodynamics and Systems**:
  - In closed systems:
    - Entropy leads to the dissolution of distinctions.
  - **Negentropy**: Situations where entropy decreases, leading to increased order.

- **Open Systems**:
  - Defined by **exchange relationships** between a system and its environment.
  - Systems must interact with external elements to maintain themselves.

## **General Sociological Context**
- **Structuralism**:
  - Emphasizes coherence and stability in societal structures.
  - Reductionist in its approach to analyzing society.

- **Functionalism**:
  - Views society as an **emergent system**:
    - Parts of society interdependently work together to promote stability and solidarity.
    - Institutions and processes sustain the whole.
