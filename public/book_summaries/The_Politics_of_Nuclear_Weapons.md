# Notes from *The Politics of Nuclear Weapons*

---

## **Introduction**
- **Historical Significance**:
  - Nuclear weapons have been central to international security since 1945.
  - Despite the end of the Cold War (1945–1991), nuclear threats persist.

- **Nuclear-Armed States**:
  - **Nine known states** possess nuclear weapons:
    - Openly declared: **Russia, USA, UK, China, France, India, Pakistan, North Korea**.
    - Believed but unconfirmed: **Israel**.
  - The **1968 Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT)**:
    - Signed by the first five nuclear powers.
    - India, Pakistan, North Korea, and Israel developed nuclear weapons post-NPT.

- **Canceled Nuclear Programs**:
  - Several nations voluntarily or forcibly terminated their nuclear weapons programs.

- **NATO Agreements**:
  - Many U.S. nuclear weapons are stored in Europe under NATO treaties.

## **What Are Nuclear Weapons?**
- **Mechanism**:
  - A nuclear explosion occurs when an unstable isotope’s nucleus is bombarded with neutrons, causing **fission** and releasing massive energy.
  - Usable materials:
    - **Uranium-235** (natural but requires enrichment).
    - **Plutonium-239** (man-made, derived from uranium fission).

- **Enrichment and Purity**:
  - Civilian nuclear reactors use **low-enriched uranium (LEU)** (~5% purity).
  - Weapons require **high-enriched uranium (HEU)** (80–90% purity).

- **Historical Milestones**:
  - **Einstein-Szilard letter** initiated U.S. atomic weapons development.
  - **Manhattan Project** (1942):
    - First test: **July 16, 1945**, New Mexico.
    - Bombs dropped on Japan:
      - **Uranium bomb** (Hiroshima).
      - **Plutonium bomb** (Nagasaki).
  - Post-war focus shifted to **fusion bombs (H-Bombs)**:
    - First tested in **1952** (USA) and **1953** (USSR, Kazakhstan).

## **Testing, Defining, and Delivering Nuclear Weapons**
- **Key Treaties**:
  - **1963 Partial Test Ban Treaty (PTBT)**: Banned testing above ground, in the sea, and in space.
  - **1974 Threshold Test Ban Treaty (TTBT)**: Limited test size to less than 150kt.
  - **1996 Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT)**: Aimed to ban all testing, though not universally ratified.

- **Radionuclides**:
  - Key particles causing sickness include **Caesium-137, Iodine-131**, and **Strontium-90**.

## **Nuclear Proliferation**
### **Types of Proliferation**:
1. **Vertical Proliferation**:
   - Development and stockpiling of nuclear weapons by nuclear-armed states.
2. **Horizontal Proliferation**:
   - Spread of nuclear weapons capabilities to additional states or actors.

### **Managing Proliferation**:
- Strategies:
  1. **Diplomatic negotiations**.
  2. **International regimes** (e.g., NPT) backed by enforcement mechanisms.
  3. **Mitigation of accidental or deliberate nuclear threats**.
- **Arms Control**:
  - Efforts to minimize or offset military expectations through:
    - Limiting nuclear testing.
    - Regulating development, deployment, and use of nuclear weapons.
  - Agreements:
    - Bilateral agreements (e.g., USA-Russia) have been most successful.
    - Multilateral agreements (e.g., CTBT, FMCT) face challenges.

## **Active and Passive Defence**
- **Active Defence**:
  - Systems designed to intercept and neutralize nuclear threats before they hit targets.
  - Examples:
    - **Ballistic Missile Defence (BMD)**.
    - Air defence, anti-submarine, and anti-satellite weapons.
  - Seen as destabilizing because they undermine the credibility of a second-strike capability.

## **Nuclear Weapons and Non-State Actors**
- **Threat of Non-State Actors**:
  - Terrorist groups acquiring nuclear weapons or fissile material pose a unique challenge.
  - Unlike nation-states, non-state actors are less susceptible to deterrence through retaliation.

- **Illicit Smuggling**:
  - Example: **A.Q. Khan Network**:
    - Helped develop Pakistan’s nuclear program in the 1970s.
    - Operated front companies to procure components.
    - Convicted of espionage in 1983 but protected by Pakistan.

## **Nuclear Disarmament**
- **Mixed Record**:
  - Nuclear weapons have not been abolished, but progress includes:
    - Large **nuclear weapons-free zones**.
    - Several states renouncing nuclear arms.
    - Increased global pressure for disarmament since the 1950s and 1980s.

- **Notable Initiatives**:
  - **Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists**:
    - Publishes the **Doomsday Clock** (since 1947) to measure proximity to nuclear disaster.
  - **1946 International Atomic Development Authority (IADA)**:
    - Created by the USA under the UN to oversee atomic energy and nuclear weapons.
