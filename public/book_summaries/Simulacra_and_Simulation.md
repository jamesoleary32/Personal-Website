Simulacra and Simulation
Definitions:
Simulation
Simulacra
Frisson = a sudden strong feeling of excitement or fear; a thrill.
Apotheosis = the highest point in the development of something; a culmination or climax.
Asepsis = The state of being free from disease-causing micro-organisms
simulation is characterised by the precession of the model

The confusion of the fact for the model is what allows each time for all possible interpretations, even the most contradictory — all true in the sense that their truth is to be exchanged in the image of the models from which they are derived

Everything is metamorphesed into its opposite to perpetuate itself in its expurgated form.

Watergate was a success insofar it imposed the idea that Water even was a scandal!

Illusion is no longer real because the real is no longer possible

Network of artificial signs mixed with the real

Parody renders submission and transgression equialent

capital exterminated all use value, all real equivalence of production and wealth

Dream of power: to be taken seriously enough to constitute a mortal enough danger to the group to be one day relieved of his duties

From a political perspective, that a head of state remains the same or changes doesnt strictly change anything as long as they resemble each other.

apotheosis of simulation — the nuclear

The balance of terror is the terror of balance

Pacification doesn’t distinguish between the civil and the military

The USA pulled out of Vietnam but won the war. The war ended spontaneously when this objective was achieved.

Lockdown and control increase in direct proportion to liberating potentialities.

Precession of Simulacra
The divine irreverence of images:
To dissimulate is to pretend not to have what one has. To simulate is to feign what one doesn’t have. Whoever simulates an illness produces in themself some of the symptoms. The act of pretending/dissimulating leaves the prinicple of reality intact: the difference is always clear. Simulation threatens the difference between true & false, real & imaginary. Is the simulator sick if they produce true symptoms. If any symptom can be prodcued and can no longer be taken as a fact o fnature, every illness can be considered simulatable and simulated.

Even Military psychology draws back from cartesian certainties

Cartesian certainty: truth is a binary relationship between thought and object, the relationship of conformity.

If he is this good at acting crazy it is because he is

The divinity that animates nature can never be represented. What comes of divinity when it reveals itself in icons, when it is multiplied in simulacra.

Simulacra efface God form the conscience of man and leads to the truth that God never existed only the simulacrum ever existed and that God himself was nothing but his own simulacrum. The metaphysical despair ame from the idea that the image didn’t conceal anything at all.

All Western faith and good faith became engaged in a wager on representation: that a sign could refer to the depth of meaning, that a sign could be exchanged for meaning and that something could guarantee this exchange (God). What if God can be simulated, i.e. reduced to the signs that constitute faith.

Representation stems from the principle of the equivalence of the sign and of the real.

The imaginary of Disneyland is neither true nor false it is a machine set up to rejuvenate the fiction of the real in the other camp. The world wants us to be childish in order to make us believe that the adults are elsewhere, in the real world and to hence conceal the true childishness in everywhere.

The objectivity of facts does not put an end to the vertigo of interpretation. We are in a logic of simulation which no longer has anything to do with a logic of facts and the order of reason. The facts no longer have a specific trajectory they are born at the intersection of models. It is the secret of a discourse that is longer simply ambiguous, as political discourses can be, but that conveys the impossibility of a determined position of power.
