## Preface
- pure military strategy needs to be viewed from the higher plane of grand strategy

- overthrow of germany made way for russia
- Atomic power is stimulating a reversion to indirect methods of warfare e.g. guerilla strategy

- “Ironically, the further we have developed the massive effect of the bombing weapon, the more we have helped the progress of this new guerilla-type strategy.”
- “The history of strategy is fundamentally a record of the application and ever the indirect approach.”
- “As in war, the aim is to weaken resistance before attempting to overcome it, and the effect is best attained by drawing the other party out of his defenses.”
- “Avoid a frontal attack on a long established position. Instead, seek to turn it by a flank movement, so that the more vulnerable side is exposed to the thrust of truth. But in any search in direct approach, take care not to divert from the truth, for nothing is more fatal to its real advancement than to lapse into untruth.”
- “There are two forms of practical experience, direct and indirect, and of the two, indirect practical experience may be the more valuable because infinitely wider. Even in the most active career, especially a soldier’s career, the scope and possibilities of direct experiences are extremely limited. In contrast to the military, the medical profession has incessant practice. Yet the great advances in medicine and surgery have been more due to the scientific thinker and research worker than to the practitioner.”
- “The predominance of the psychological over the physical and its greater constancy point to the conclusion that the foundation of any theory of war should be as broad as possible.”
- “Throughout the ages, effective results in war have rarely been attained unless the approach has had such indirectness, as to ***ensure the opponent is unready to meet it***. The indirectness has usually been physical and always psychological.”
- “The most natural starting point for a survey is the first Great War in European history, the Great Persian War.”
- “Historically, it is worth noting that the use of strategic mobility for indirect approach was realized and exploited much earlier at sea than in land warfare. The natural reason is that only in a late stage of development did armies come to depend upon lines of communication for their supply. Fleets, however, were used to operate against the seaborne communications or means of supply of opposing countries.”
- “Clear-cut nomenclature is essential to clear thought, and the term strategy is best confined to its literal meaning of generalship—the actual direction of military force. As distinct from the policy governing its employment and combining with other weapons—economic, political, psychological—such policy is an application of higher strategy for which the term grand strategy has been coined.”

### Chapter 2 — Roman Wars (Hannibal, Scipio, Caesar)
- The first phase opens with Hannibal’s advance from Spain toward Italy via the Alps (218 BC).
- A natural closing point for this phase is the annihilating victory at Lake Trasimene (217 BC).
- After Trasimene, Rome was left “saved by her walls and garrison”, and exposed to Hannibal’s immediate approach had he chosen to press on.
- Reason commonly cited for Hannibal’s initial choice of the circuitous and arduous land route (vs a direct sea route) is Rome’s supposed “command of the sea”. But it’s misleading to apply the modern meaning of that phrase to an era of primitive ships and highly uncertain interception at sea.
- Hannibal chose to face the most hazardous conditions rather than the certainty of meeting his opponents in a position of their own choosing.

#### Fabian strategy (Fabius)
- **Fabian strategy** (Fabius) wasn’t merely evasion to gain time; it was calculated to affect enemy morale and, especially, influence potential allies.
- It was thus primarily a matter of **war policy / grand strategy**.
- Fabius recognised Hannibal’s military superiority too well to **risk a decisive battle**.
- Instead he used **military ‘pinpricks’** to wear down the invaders while simultaneously preventing them from recruiting strength from Italian cities or from their Carthaginian base.
- A key condition was keeping the Roman army **close to the hills**, to nullify Hannibal’s tactical superiority (especially cavalry).
- This phase is framed as a link between the **Hannibalic** and **Fabian** forms of the indirect approach.

#### Scipio’s landing in Africa (204 BC)
- Scipio obtained Senate permission to cross into Africa, but was refused leave to take his blooded/veteran troops.
- Spring 204 BC: he sailed with ~7,000 volunteers and two disgraced legions relegated to garrison duty in Sicily for their share of the defeat at Cannae.
- On landing in Africa he was met by the only cavalry force Carthage had immediately available.
- By a cleverly graduated retreat, he lured it into a trap and destroyed it.
- This bought time to consolidate his position and created a moral impression: it encouraged stronger backing from home authorities while shaking Carthage’s hold on its African allies (except the most powerful).
- “A siege is the most economic of all operations of war; when the enemy has still a field army capable of intervening, a siege is also the most dangerous. For until it is crowned by success, the assailant is progressively weakening himself in proportion to his enemy.”

#### Civil War (50–45 BC): Caesar vs Pompey
- Just as the Second Punic War gave the world to Rome, the Civil War of 50–45 BC gave the Roman world to Caesar and Caesarism.
- When Caesar crossed the Rubicon (Dec 50 BC), his power rested chiefly on Gaul and Illyricum.
- Pompey controlled Italy and the rest of Rome’s dominions.
- Caesar had nine legions, but only one was with him at Ravenna; the rest were far away in Gaul.
- Pompey had ten legions in Italy, seven in Spain, and detachments around the empire.
- Instead of advancing in stages by the indirect land route through Illyricum, Caesar chose the direct sea route—gaining time initially, but losing it ultimately.
- Pompey originally had the larger fleet. Caesar had ordered shipbuilding on a large scale, but only part were ready.
- Rather than wait, Caesar sailed from Brindisi with barely half an assembled force.

### Chapter 4 — Byzantine Wars (Belisarius and Narses)
- After Caesar’s crowning victory at Munda (45 BC), he was granted perpetual dictatorship of Rome and the Roman world.
- This ‘decisive step’—a contradiction in terms—signalled the sterilisation of the constitution.
- It paved the way for the conversion of the Republic into the Empire, which carried within its system the germs of its own decay.

- ~500 years passed between Caesar’s triumph and the final collapse of Rome; even then, a Roman Empire continued for another ~1,000 years in a different location.
- Key factor: Constantine the Great transferred the capital from Rome to Byzantium (Constantinople).
- The Roman world was definitively divided into Eastern and Western empires (364 AD).
- The Eastern empire kept its strength better; the West increasingly crumbled under barbarian attacks until near the end of the 5th century AD.
- Independent barbarian kingdoms emerged in Italy (after similar kingdoms in Gaul, Spain, and Africa), alongside the deposition of the nominal Western emperor.

### Chapter 4 — Byzantine Wars (Belisarius and Narses)
- Belisarius’ army bore little resemblance to the classical patterns of the legionary army.
- It was closer to the medieval form, but more highly developed.
- Later, by the time of Justinian, the *principal arm was heavy cavalry*, armed with bow as well as lance, and clad in armour.
- The underlying idea was to *combine the value of mobile firepower and mobile shock power; in some respects it foreshadowed modern light and heavy/medium tanks*.
- The infantry likewise were of light and heavy types, but the heavier infantry (with heavier spears and a close-locked formation) served as a stable pivot around which the cavalry could manoeuvre in battle.
- The Byzantine bow outranged the Persian.
- Persian armour was not proof against the Byzantine arrow (though it was proof against the Persian).

#### Belisarius on “true victory” and leaving an enemy an escape route
- Having frustrated the threat, Belisarius was content to shepherd the invaders back on their homeward course.
- Such restraint did not please his troops. Aware of their murmurs, he tried to point out that true victory lay in *compelling one’s opponent to abandon his purpose* with the least possible loss to oneself.
- If such a result was obtained, there was no real advantage to be gained by winning a battle; attempting one would incur a needless risk of defeat, and thereby leave the Empire open to a more dangerous invasion.
- To leave a retreating army a way of escape was the surest way to infuse it with the courage of desperation.
- While the reconquest of Roman Africa had looked a desperate venture in prospect, it proved astoundingly simple in execution.

#### Belisarius vs the Goths at Rome
- At this point, the Goths were occupying Rome, and Justinian (with Belisarius) was trying to get it back.
- The Goths had about 150,000 men and Belisarius only 10,000; however, he had roughly three months to set up defences.
- His cavalry, being armed with bows, could harass the enemy’s cavalry masses while keeping out of reach, or tease the Gothic lancers into blind charges.

#### Belisarius and Narses: psychological strategy built on tactical advantage
- At first glance, the campaigns of Belisarius and Narses appear more tactical than strategical, since many movements led directly to battle, and there are fewer examples of calculated ***manoeuvring against the enemy’s communications*** than in the campaigns of other great captains.
- But closer examination modifies this impression.
- Belisarius developed a new tactical instrument with which he could beat much superior numbers—provided he could induce his opponents to attack under conditions that suited his tactics.
- For that purpose, his lack of numbers was not so much a handicap as an asset, especially when covered by an audaciously direct strategic offensive.
- His strategy was thus more psychological than logistical.
- He knew how to provoke the barbarian armies of the West into indulging their natural instinct for direct assault.
- Against the more subtle and skilful Persians, he was at first able to take advantage of their feeling of superiority to the Byzantines; later he exploited their wariness as a means of outmanoeuvring them psychologically.

### Roman army transformation (between Scipio and Caesar)
- Between Scipio and Caesar, while Rome itself was changing from a city-state into an empire, the army was transformed from a short-service citizen force into a long-service professional force.
- But military organisation had not fulfilled the promise of cavalry predominance that was foreshadowed at Sama.
- The infantry was the staple of the Imperial Roman army, and the cavalry had become subsidiary, as it had been in earlier stages of the war against Hannibal.
- As the need for greater mobility and frontier defence became more evident, the proportion of cavalry was gradually increased.
- But it was not until the legions were overwhelmed at Adrianople (378) that the Roman armies came to recast and reorganise in accordance with this lesson.

### Chapter 5 — Medieval Wars
- This chapter serves merely as a link between the cycles of ancient and modern history.
- Although several medieval campaigns are tempting illustrations, the sources for knowledge of them are more exiguous and less reliable than those for earlier or later times.

#### William of Normandy: strategic distraction (indirect approach)
- William of Normandy’s invasion of England profited from a strategic distraction, and thereby gained at the outset the virtues of an indirect approach.
- This distraction was the landing of King Harold’s rebel brother, Tostig, and his ally Harald Hardrada, King of Norway, on the Yorkshire coast.
- This seemed the less immediate danger than William’s invasion, but it added effectiveness to William’s plans, even though it was promptly defeated.
- Two days after the annihilation of the northern invaders at Stamford Bridge, William landed on the Sussex coast.

#### William’s strategy after victory: secure communications, avoid direct assault
- William’s strategy after his victory is equally significant.
- Instead of marching directly on London, he first secured Dover and his own sea communications.
- On reaching the outskirts of London, he avoided any direct assault, but made a circular sweep of devastation around London to the west and then to the north.
- Threatened with starvation, the capital surrendered when William reached Berkhamsted.

#### King John (1216): strategy without battles
- The 13th century was more plentiful still in examples of his skill.
- In 1216, King John saved his kingdom after almost losing it by a campaign in which pure strategy was unmixed with battles.
- His means were mobility, the strong resisting power then possessed by fortresses, and the psychological power inherent in the townsmen’s dislike of the barons and their foreign ally, Louis of France.
### Chapter 5 — The 17th century wars 

the 30 years war 1618 - 1648, gustavus & wallenstein
the result of the war was to yield to france the position of predominant european power

contrasted with the 1642-1652 civil war in britain, which was marked by the persistent drive to decisiveness

the royal forces were based in the west / midlands, the parliamentary forces - on london 
oxford& the surrounding towns became the fortified pivot of the royalists 
charles made a truce with irish rebels - a blunder of grand strategy - pushing the  scottish presbyterians into the hands of the parliamentarians 

Fairfax & cromwell with the "new model army"
despite crowmell's eagerness for battle he only did it if he could draw the enemy into the open and attack an exposed flank.

### Chapter 8 — French Revolution and Napoleon Bonaparte
- The revolutionary spirit which inspired the citizen armies of France created such a condition and impulse simultaneously, in compensation for the precise drill which it made impossible.
- It gave reign instead to the tactical sense and initiative of the individual.
- These new tactics of fluidity had for their simple yet vital pivot the fact that the French now marched and afforded a quick step of **120 paces per minute**, while their opponents adhered to the orthodox **70 paces**.
- This elementary difference went far to make possible the rapid transference and reshuffle concentrations of striking power whereby the French could, in Napoleon’s phrase, **“multiply mass by velocity”**, both strategically and tactically.

- Another favourable condition was the organisation of the army into **permanent divisions** — fractioning the army into self-contained parts which, while operating separately, could cooperate to a common goal.
- This organic change had been initiated by **Bourcet** (and others) and to some extent applied in practice during the **1740s**.
- Linked with this: the chaotic supply system and indiscipline of the revolutionary armies meant a reversion to the old practice of **living off the country**.
- *Because the army was distributed into divisions, this detracted less from effectiveness than in the old days, where formerly the fractions had to be collected before they could carry out an operation.*
- *Now they could be serving a military purpose while feeding themselves*.

- From **Bourcet**, Napoleon learned the principle of **calculated dispersion** to induce the enemy to disperse their own concentration — preparatory to the **swift reuniting** of his own forces.
- Also: the value of a plan with several branches of operation, threatening **alternative objectives**.
- Moreover, the very plan Napoleon executed in his first campaign was based on one that Bourcet had designed **half a century earlier**.

- ***Bonaparte developed the new divisional system further: an army was permanently subdivided into independently moving fractions, rather than being constituted as a single body from which only temporary detachments were made***.
- The group formation of Bonaparte’s Italian campaigns became a more highly developed form, anticipating the **army corps** that would place divisions in his later wars.
- This conception of a **strategic barrage** was Bonaparte’s chief contribution to the strategy of the **indirect approach**.

- After several years of uneasy peace, the curtain that had fallen on the French Revolutionary Wars rose on a new act: the **Napoleonic Wars**.
- In **1805**, Napoleon’s army of ~**200,000** men was assembled at **Boulogne**, menacing a descent on the English coast, when it was suddenly directed by forced marches to the **Rhine**.
- It is still uncertain whether Napoleon seriously intended a direct invasion of England, or whether the threat was merely the first move in his indirect approach to **Austria**.
- Likely he was acting on **Bourcet’s** principle of a plan with branches when he decided to take the eastward branch.
- He calculated the Austrians would, as usual, send an army into **Bavaria** to block access via the **Black Forest**.
- On this basis he planned his wide manoeuvre around their northern flank across the **Danube** and onto the **Lech**; his intended strategic barrage crossed their rear.
- It was a repetition on a grander scale of the **Stradella manoeuvre**, and Napoleon himself emphasised the parallel to his troops.

- It is curious how the possession of a **blank cheque** on the “bank of manpower” has an analogous effect in **1807–14** and in **1914–18**.
- Curious also that in each case it was associated with the method of **intense artillery bombardment**.
- Possible explanation: lavish expenditure brings **extravagance** — the mental antithesis of the **economy of force** to which surprise and mobility are the means.
- This hypothesis is strengthened by similar effects seen in **Napoleon’s policy**.

#### Spain: guerrilla war
- The French had beaten—and continued to beat—any regular Spanish forces, but the thoroughness of these defeats was the greatest benefit to the defeated.
- The main effort of the Spanish was thrown into **guerrilla warfare**.
- An intangible web of guerrilla resistance replaced a vulnerable military target.
- Enterprising and unconventional guerrilla leaders, instead of hidebound Spanish generals, conducted operations.
### Conclusions 
- Natural hazards are inherently less dangerous and less uncertain than fighting hazards 
- In almost all cases the victor had the opponent at a psychological disadvantgae
