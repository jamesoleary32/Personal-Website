# The Objective
The objective of this work is to develop a general explanation of collapse, applicable within a variety of contexts and with implications for current conditions. This is a work of archaeology and history and of social theory.

## Collapse
A society is collapsed when it displays a rapid drop in sociopolitical complexity.

# Chapter 2: The Nature of Complex Societies

## In this chapter, three things are discussed:
1. The nature of complexity.
2. The question of whether complexity is a continuum or discretely characterised.
3. Major views on the emergence of complex societies.

---

## Two concepts important to understanding the nature of complexity:
1. **Inequality**
   - May be thought of as vertical differentiation.
2. **Heterogeneity**
   - A subtler concept; it refers to the number of distinctive parts or components of a society and to the way in which society is distributed across them.

- Inequality and heterogeneity are interrelated but, in part, respond to different processes and are not always positively correlated in sociopolitical evolution.

---

## Characteristics of Complex Societies
- Complex societies tend to be “nearly decomposable systems.” That is, they are at least partly built up of social units that are themselves potentially stable and independent.
- For example, a newly established state may include several formerly independent villages, or an empire may incorporate previously established states.
- A collapse process may result in the reversion to the constituent elements of the lower level of complexity.

---

## States
- States are territorially organised.
  - Membership is at least partly determined by birth or residence in a territory rather than kin relations.

- States contrast with relatively complex tribal societies such as chiefdoms in a number of ways:
  - In states, a ruling authority monopolises sovereignty and delegates all power.
  - The ruling class tends to be professional and not bound by kinship.
  - This ruling class supplies the personnel for government.
  - The government is legitimately constituted.
  - States are the only kind of human society that does not ordinarily undergo short-term cycles of formation and dissolution.
  - States are internally differentiated. Specialisation is a clear characteristic, which is often reflected in patterns of residence.

---

## Durkheim's Perspective
- Recognised the evolution from primitive to complex societies witnessed the transformation of groups based on what he denoted as:
  - **Mechanical solidarity**: Found in primitive societies.
  - **Organic solidarity**: Found in complex societies, characterised by cultural and economic differentiation requiring interaction and greater cohesiveness.

---

## Legitimacy
- Despite an institutionalised authority structure, an ideological basis, and a monopoly of force, rulers of states still need to constantly reinforce their legitimacy.
- Legitimacy mainly declines when authorities are unable to meet the demands of the support population.

---

## Levels of Complexity
- One of the basic assumptions of the typological approach is that as societies increase in complexity, they do so by leaps from one structurally stable level to another.
- The alternative approach is that increases in complexity operate along a continuous scale.
- In the process of classification, information about variety is lost while information about similarities is gained.
- The utility of a classification must be at least partially judged by whether the quantity and quality of information gained outweigh what is lost.

---

## Types of Early States
1. **The inchoate early state**
   - Kinship and family ties dominate political relations.
   - Limited specialisation.
   - Ad hoc taxation.
2. **The typical early state**
   - Kinship balanced by ties to locality.
   - Competition and appointment counterbalance heredity.
   - Leading administrative roles are allocated to non-kinsmen.
3. **The transitional early state**
   - Kinship affects only marginal aspects of government.

---

## The Evolution of Complexity
- The origins of complex societies remain controversial.
- Long-standing states have acquired in their later history so many functions and features that their original functions are often obscured.

---

## Major Lines of Thought Around the Origin of the State
1. **Managerial**
2. **Internal conflict**
3. **External conflict**
4. **Synthetic**

---

## Secondary State Formation
- The emergence of complexity among the competitors and trade partners of states yields the process of secondary state formation.
- So far, there have been only six instances of primary state formation.

---

## Schools of Thought on the Origin of the State

### Conflict Theory
- Asserts that the state emerged out of the needs and desires of individuals and subgroups of a society.
- Based on divided interests, domination, and exploitation, and primarily a stage for power struggles.
- Its clearest expression is in the Marxist school.

### Integrationist/Functionalist Theory
- Suggests that complexity, stratification, and the state arose from the needs of society.
- Major elements of this approach:
  - Shared rather than divided interests.
  - Common advantages instead of dominance and exploitation.
  - Consensus, not coercion.
  - Societies as integrated systems rather than stages for power struggles.

# Chapter 3: The Study of Collapse

A civilisation is the cultural system of a complex society. The features that popularly define a complex society are epiphenomenal or covariables of social, political, and economic complexity.

## Classification of Theories

There appear to be 11 major themes in the explanation of collapse:

1. Resource depletion  
2. Establishment of a new resource base  
3. The occurrence of an insurmountable catastrophe  
4. Insufficient flexibility to circumstance  
5. Other complex societies  
6. Intruders  
7. Class conflict, societal contradictions, elite mismanagement  
8. Social dysfunction  
9. Mystical factors  
10. Chance concatenation of events  
11. Economic factors  

### New Resource

### Catastrophes

The fundamental problem is that complex societies routinely withstand catastrophes without collapsing. Thus catastrophe arguments present an incomplete causal chain: the basic assumption must be that the catastrophes in question somehow exceeded the abilities of the species to absorb and recover from disaster.

### Insufficient Response to Circumstances

Self-sufficiency and autonomy of local systems are reduced as specialization increases. As special-purpose subsystems become increasingly differentiated, stability declines.  

Efficiency leads to inflexibility in resource allocation. The mechanism is this: a newly dominant state controls a large territorial base but has not yet developed complex institutions that will derive a significant return for this resource base.  

In such situations, a large proportion of the new resources will always be used in non-critical or low-return ways (such as monumental architecture). This has the consequence of creating a hidden resource that can be used in a crisis, as such non-critical activities are suspendable in crises.

# Chapter 4: Understanding Collapse - The Marginal Productivity of Sociopolitical Change

Human societies and political organizations are sustained by a continuous flow of energy.  
The mechanisms by which human groups acquire and distribute basic resources are conditioned by and integrated within sociopolitical institutions.  
Energy flow and sociopolitical organization are opposite sides of the equation.  

The per capita energy required to maintain simple institutions is far lower than to sustain the most complex.

## Four Concepts to Understand Collapse:

1. Human societies are problem-solving organizations.  
2. Sociopolitical systems require energy for their maintenance.  
3. Increased complexity carries with it increased per-capita costs.  
4. Investment in sociopolitical complexity as a problem-solving response often reaches a point of declining marginal returns.

## The Marginal Productivity of Increasing Complexity

Breaking complexity down into its constituent parts:

- **Agriculture and resource production**  
- **Information processing**  
- **Sociopolitical control and specialization**  
- **Overall economic productivity**  

### Agriculture and Resource Production

Marginal returns on agriculture, in a subsistence economy, decrease with increasing labor.

### Information Processing

The cost of information processing in many spheres shows a trend of declining marginal productivity.  
The marginal cost of useful information grows rapidly because the redundancy of information increases.  

The marginal productivity of R&D in the USA depicts a disturbing trend.  
The number of patent applications per capita rose until about 1920 and then began to decline.  

Fritz Machlup (who popularized the concept of the information society) suggests that the major part of the decline in patenting is due to the growth in military R&D, which doesn’t typically yield patentable inventions.  
However, this secular trend is observed in countries that didn’t invest heavily in military R&D as well as in many fields unrelated to military R&D.  

Investment in education shows declining marginal productivity. Between 1870 and 1960, the percentage of the US population enrolled in higher education went from **1.7% → 33.5%**, consuming **0.26% → 1.23%** of GNP.  

With increasing time in education and greater specialization, the learning that occurs yields decreased general benefits for increasing costs.

**Axiom:** Generalized learning is of greater value than specialized learning.

The overall productivity of investment in higher education for the development of specialized expertise has declined substantially since 1900. Educating scientists leads the number of average scientists to rise faster than the most productive.  

The benefits from specialized training are equally attributable to the generalized education that preceded it.  

A pattern of increasing hierarchical control and specialization characterizes the private sector as strongly as it does the public sector.  
Larger organizations need to spend a larger amount of time processing information and integrating disparate parts.  

Technical innovation occurs along a curve of declining marginal productivity (**S-Curve dynamics**).  
But what about revolutionary innovation?  

Science is not an entirely linear, cumulative process. The knowledge of greatest lasting benefit comes from the general formulation that initiates a paradigm.  

The production function of science follows the standard neoclassical properties of diminishing returns to R&D expenditures.

---

## Sociopolitical Control and Specialization

Control and specialization are the essence of a complex society. The reasons why investment in complexity yields diminishing returns include:

- Increasing size of bureaucracies  
- Increasing specialization of bureaucracies  
- The cumulative nature of organizational solutions (e.g., legislation and recursively solving for loopholes)  
- Increasing taxation  
- Increasing costs of legitimizing activities  
- Increasing costs of internal control and external defense  

It may well be that the overall trend of declining marginal productivity in a society simply leaves proportionally less capital for investment in future growth.

---

## Explaining Collapse

1. Human societies are problem-solving organizations.  
2. Sociopolitical systems require energy for maintenance.  
3. Increased complexity carries increased per-capita costs.  
4. Investment in sociopolitical complexity as a problem-solving response often reaches a point of declining marginal returns.  

Complexity in society refers to the interlinked growth of the several subsystems that comprise a society.

---

## Conclusion

Energy is the essential bottleneck for everything.

There are two general factors that combine to make a society vulnerable to collapse when investment in complexity begins to yield declining marginal returns:

1. **Stress surges** of great magnitude cannot be accommodated without reserves.  
2. Declining marginal returns make complexity a less attractive problem-solving strategy.  

The marginal cost of evolution to a higher level of complexity, or of remaining at the present level, is high compared with the alternative of disintegration.  

In the late Roman and Byzantine empires, the overtaxed peasantry offered little resistance to the foreign incursions that ultimately toppled those regimes.  

**Why does an equilibrium situation not develop when marginal productivity can no longer rise?**  
Why can’t a society reach an optimum cost/benefit ratio and rest on its accomplishments?

## Alternatives to Collapse

Institutionalized technical innovation is unusual in human history—it requires R&D investment, which requires a decent surplus.  

Technical innovation often responds to labor shortages, which in the ancient world were the exception. Hence, technical R&D in ancient societies was minimal.  

In industrial societies, innovation responds to market factors, particularly physical needs and economic stress.  

For human societies, the best key to continued socioeconomic growth and avoiding or circumventing declines in marginal productivity is to obtain a new energy subsidy when it is clear that marginal productivity is beginning to drop.  

**Among modern societies,** this has been achieved through fossil fuels and nuclear energy.  
**Among ancient societies,** this was achieved through territorial expansion.
