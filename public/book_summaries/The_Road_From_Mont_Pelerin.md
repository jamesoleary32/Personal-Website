- **[Neoliberalism](../notes/Neoliberalism)** 

## **Preface**
- **Overview**:
  - This book offers profound insights into **[Neoliberalism](../notes/Neoliberalism)** and **liberalism**, surpassing other works on the subject while avoiding propagandistic promotion of these ideologies.
  - **Neoliberalism**:
    - Does not assume the existence of a pristine, stable free market.
    - A **pluralistic ideology**, resisting a singular, reified definition.

- **Key Observations**:
  - Neoliberalism often linked to intellectual strands like:
    - Chicago School
    - Ordoliberalism
    - Austrian Economics
    - Libertarianism
    - Neoclassical Economics.
  - Arguments against neoliberalism’s existence reflect naivety about the interaction of ideas and political movements.

## **Introduction**
- **Stereotypes**:
  - Neoliberals often mischaracterized as neoclassical economists, despite contradictions in this representation.
  - In the U.S., "neoliberalism" rarely describes free-market ideologies, which instead align with **libertarianism** or **neoconservatism**.

- **Origins and Goals**:
  - Developed as an opposition to **collectivism** and **socialism**.
  - Focused on promoting:
    - **Competition** and **entrepreneurship**.
    - Rejection of socialist ideas, particularly **Bolshevism**.
  - Central message:
    - The **market** is superior to **state intervention**.

 [The Washington Consensus](../notes/The-Washington-Consensus)

- **Key Figures and Concepts**:
  - **John Williamson**:
    - Coined the term *Washington Consensus* (WC):
      - Combined macroeconomic stability policies with liberalization reforms.
  - **Walter Lippmann**:
    - Defined totalitarianism through the absence of property rights rather than the lack of democracy.

## **Core Tenets of Neoliberalism** (As Defined by the Mont Pelerin Colloquium)
1. **Priority of the price mechanism**.
2. **Free enterprise**.
3. **System of competition**.
4. **A strong and impartial state**.

- In contrast to British liberalism:
  - Political freedom was traditionally seen as a prerequisite for economic freedom.
  - Neoliberalism positioned **economics** as the foundation for preserving **individual choice** and political freedom.
