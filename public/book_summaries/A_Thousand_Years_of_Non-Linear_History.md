# Notes from *A Thousand Years of Non-Linear History*

---

## **Urbanisation as a Discontinuous Phenomenon**
- **The Birth of Europe (~11th Century)**:
  - Enabled by agricultural innovations:
    - Heavy plough.
    - Improved harnessing of horse energy.
    - Open field system.
    - Triennial crop rotation.

- **Processes Leading to City Formation**:
  1. Spontaneous development shaped by topography or village amalgamation.
  2. Conscious planning for orderly development.

- **Markets and Bureaucracies**:
  - Markets emerge where decision-making agents regularly assemble.
  - Bureaucracies facilitate planned extraction of energy surpluses.
  - Informal constraints in small markets reduce transaction costs.

- **Planned vs. Spontaneous Money**:
  - Monetary systems (planned) often triumph over spontaneous money due to political origins.
  - Gresham’s Law: Planned money inevitably outcompetes spontaneous money.

- **Role of Friction**:
  - Delays, bottlenecks, and uneven resource distribution generate self-organization.
  - Non-linear market dynamics emphasize uncertainty, bounded rationality, and information costs.

## **Formation of Cities**
- **Meshworks vs. Hierarchies**:
  - Long-distance trading centers formed interlocking systems (meshworks).
  - Gateway cities diffused cultural elements from diverse regions.
  - Cities do not globally optimize but evolve through cooperation and conflict.

- **Historical Insights**:
  - By the 13th century, London had specialized bureaucracy for water management.
  - Waste management systems emerged only in the 19th century despite crises.

- **Energy and Matter Flows**:
  - Urban and environmental systems interact non-linearly:
    - Oceans and atmosphere form a system with ten times the solar energy plants capture through photosynthesis.
    - Human systems mirror geological and ecological stratification.

## **Industrial and Economic Evolution**
- **Trajectories of Industry**:
  1. **Large-Scale, Energy-Intensive**: Functionally homogeneous towns.
  2. **Small-Scale, Skill-Intensive**: Heterogeneous settlements with specialized economic functions.

- **Urban Growth**:
  - England (1750–1850): Explosive urbanization driven by coal and industrial innovation.
  - Coal regions became the birthplace of railways.

- **Economies of Agglomeration**:
  - Small businesses rely on proximity to specialized clients, suppliers, and employees.
  - These dynamics foster specialization and interconnectedness more than large-scale economies.

## **Human and Natural Systems**
- **Urban Ecosystems**:
  - Medieval cities functioned as "epidemiological laboratories."
  - Urban ecosystems resemble food webs with distinct social niches, shaped by access to resources.

- **Agricultural and Industrial Innovations**:
  - Crop rotation and livestock coevolution increased agricultural productivity.
  - Hybrid crops introduced homogenization and dependence on chemical inputs.

- **Military and Industrial Discipline**:
  - Techniques from French arsenals (18th century) combined physical discipline with hygiene.
  - Industrial production routinized and standardized, leading to worker deskilling.

## **Cultural and Linguistic Evolution**
- **Linguistic Replicators**:
  - Languages evolve through accumulation of replicators (vowels, consonants, syntactic patterns).
  - Communicative isolation transforms linguistic replicators into distinct entities.

- **Influence of Writing Systems**:
  - Writing systems homogenize languages and amplify conservative trends.
  - Printing innovations (e.g., Gutenberg's press) automated text reproduction and solidified linguistic forms.

- **Memes and Norms**:
  - Cultural evolution involves multiple replication mechanisms:
    - **Memes**: Spread through imitation.
    - Forced repetition: Reinforces cultural patterns.

## **Historical and Ecological Impacts**
- **Ecosystem Stability**:
  - Stability correlates with heterogeneity in food webs.
  - Cities disrupt natural nutrient cycles and direct resources to human use.

- **Historical Events**:
  - 14th-century ecological crises involved deforestation, nutrient cycle disruptions, and depopulation due to plague.
  - European grasses coevolved with livestock, outcompeting local vegetation during colonization.

- **Innovations and Homogenization**:
  - Homogenization of crops and livestock intensified dependence on industrial agriculture.
  - Corporations engineered crops with genetic traits favoring factory routines rather than resilience.

## **Key Insights**
1. **Non-Linear Dynamics**:
   - Cities, markets, and ecosystems evolve through feedback loops, cooperation, and conflict.
2. **Meshworks vs. Hierarchies**:
   - Urban and economic systems often blend decentralized (meshwork) and centralized (hierarchical) structures.
3. **Cultural Evolution**:
   - Language and culture evolve as self-organized systems shaped by replication and imitation.
4. **Ecological Interactions**:
   - Human societies mirror natural systems, with similar processes of stratification and adaptation.
