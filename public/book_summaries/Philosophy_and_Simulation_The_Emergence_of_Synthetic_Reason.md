Mechanism-independence:
The idea is that the properties of a complex system are not solely determined by the behaviour of its underlying components(mechanisms) the system has irreducible properties. DeLanda challenges the idea of complex systems as simply the behaviour of their individual parts

symbolic vs non-symbolic representation
Symbolic: representations that use language (symbols) to represent mental states
Non-Symbolic (neural net): a representation that is captured by some vector of weights

Symbolic representations can emerge from non-symbolic representations through a process of abstraction that identifies and represents the essential features of a concept using symbols.

Organisms developed internal models of their environment. Assemblies of neurons allow and their emergent capacities modulate inherited behavioural responses during the lifetime of an organism

Capacities include sensitivisation and habituation:
Habituation is the transformation of a significant stimulus into a less significant one
Senstivisation is the transformation of an insignificant stimulus into a more significant one

The above capacities only imply the possession of innate internal models,
More complex assemblies permit learning and the generation of internal models during the lifetime of the organism.

classical conditioning:
When an inherited association forms the basis of a novel assocation with a stimulus with insignificant priors indicates the formation of a true internal model. A causal link between stimuli and their source is being created

The representation being generated by this simple organism cannot be symbolic. Understanding representation from the perspective of mechanism independence

Neural Nets
The simplest artificial neural net has neurons arranged in two layers
a perceptron is a device that maps an input pattern to an output pattern
Artificial nets are studied in a disembodied state ignoring the details of the process generating the input pattern

A perceptron maps an input pattern to an output pattern, this association is generated through training. Training consists in repeatedly passing a pattern through the input layer (heterogeneously activating these input units) a desired activation pattern is fixed at the output layer.

What does each iteration of training consist of?

Training vs Evolutionary Search as two methods of learning
Evolution is always embedded in physical environments distributed with risks and opportunities

Gradient Descent
The core of a neural net training process is it’s learning rule, a process for adjusting the connection weights such that inputs passed through the neural net

Backpropagation was developed in the context of multi-layered neural networks. A training process guided by backpropagation is a search in the space of possible weight configurations (gradient descent)

There are emergent non-symbolic representations from neural nets
Concept of a prototype extracted from experienced and stored as a non-symbolic representation plays a crucial role in explaining animal behaviour

The moment we embody a neural net and situate the simulated body in a space that can affect and be affected by it
Creates can be interpreted as displaying intentionality
Neural nets are exogenously trained

To what extent do artificial neural nets create links between their internal representations and the external world

LEE (Latent Energy Environments) endogenise the learning process through an adaptation of back-propagation

Perception and memory allow us to go beyond consideration of only stimuli

Content of memories must be considered as having significance — not necessarily signification (which is a linguistic concept, relating to the meaning of linguistic structures)

Types of memory:
Procedural — generally reflexive
Declarative
- Episodic (a type of declarative) (personal sense impressions)
- Semantic (a type of declarative) (linguistically expressed facts)
Working
Object Recognition vs Scene Analysis
Animals have been shown to be able to engage in two way classification
