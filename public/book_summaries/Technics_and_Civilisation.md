# Notes from *Technics and Civilization* by Lewis Mumford

---

## **Innovations in Mining**
### **Mining in Antiquity**
- Mining tools remained crude (e.g., pick and hammer) until modern times.
- Related techniques like smelting, refining, and casting evolved, increasing production speed.

### **The Lathe**
- A critical precision instrument for shaping materials and transmitting motion.

### **Neolithic Innovation**
- **Key Improvements**:
  - Order and security fostered cooperative social and economic life.
  - Early trade in goods like amber, obsidian, flint, and salt.
- **Social Structure**:
  - Transmission of craft knowledge created **occupational castes**.
  - Civilisation’s progress depends on a dynamic balance between life-preserving and life-destroying functions.

### **Mining and Capitalism**
- Initially, mining was undertaken by **free men** in partnerships.
- **14th–16th Century Germany**:
  - Rapid technical improvements in mining.
  - Mines required substantial capital for innovations like pumps, ore-hauling machinery, and ventilation.
  - Resulted in absentee ownership and the emergence of mining shares, marking an early form of financial speculation.
- **Economic Impacts**:
  - Workers lost control over mines, shifting from profit shares to wages.
  - Mining as an early example of **capital-intensive industry**.

### **Mining and Warfare**
- Advances in warfare, particularly artillery, increased demand for metals like iron and lead.
- Mining became intertwined with mechanisation, finance, and military needs.

## **The Eotechnic Phase**
### **Overview**
- Characterised by **water and wood** as dominant forms of energy and material.
- Technological progress driven by tools, machines, and innovations in power generation and navigation.

### **Key Innovations**
1. **Power Machinery**:
   - Waterwheels (invented in the 3rd century BC) became widespread in Europe by the 14th century.
   - **Fourneyron’s water turbine** improved energy conversion efficiency, paving the way for modern hydropower.
2. **Navigation**:
   - Mariner’s compass (12th century), permanent rudder (13th century), and clock-aided celestial navigation (16th century).
3. **Canals**:
   - Supplemented natural waterways from the 16th century onward.
   - Britain experienced "canal mania" during the late 18th and early 19th centuries.

### **Materials and Methods**
- Glass reintroduced in the Middle Ages, transforming indoor life by extending the day.
- **Capitalism’s Role**:
  - Growth of patents and monopolies for chartered companies.
  - **Experimental Method**: Organised experience into mechanical causality, enabling repeatable, verifiable experiments.

## **The Paleotechnic Phase**
### **Characteristics**
- Commonly identified with the **First Industrial Revolution** (18th–19th century England).
- Dominated by **coal and iron**, leading to industrial-scale mining and manufacturing.

### **Technological Progress**
1. **Coal and Iron**:
   - Charcoal gave way to coal for more efficient iron production.
   - High-powered blast furnaces enabled large-scale steel production.
2. **Steam Power**:
   - Watt’s steam engine improved upon Newcomen’s design.
   - Powered pumps to remove water from mines, enabling deeper excavation.

### **Social and Economic Changes**
- Increased reliance on machines led to **greater subjugation of workers**.
- Mining became central to this phase, transitioning from manual labor to a mining civilization.
- **Henry Adams' Phase Rule**: Applied physical principles to historical patterns, reflecting the era's scientific influence.

## **Other Notable Insights**
### **Wood as a Material**
- Combines properties of stone and metal:
  - High tensile and compressive strength with elasticity.
  - Enabled innovations like mine shoring and barrels.

### **Warfare and Mechanisation**
- Artillery exemplified the mechanisation of war.
- Military regimentation influenced broader societal structures, emphasizing mechanical obedience.

## **General Reflections**
- Each technological phase represents a unique **meshwork of energy sources, materials, and social objectives**.
- Innovations in energy and material use (e.g., water, wood, coal, iron) drove progress and shaped civilisation.
- Industrial phases illustrate the growing interplay between **technology, society, and capitalism**.
