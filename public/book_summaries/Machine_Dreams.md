## Key Concepts

### Cyborg Science and Economics
- Economics reframed: **Optimal allocation of scarce resources** → **Processing of information**.
- Postwar economics evolved with developments like **game theory**, **rational expectations theory**, and **bounded rationality**.
- Intersection of economics with natural sciences:
  - Utility patterned on **potential energy** from classical mechanics.
  - **Cybernetics** introduced goal-oriented feedback mechanisms.

---

## The Military's Role in Science and Economics
- **Bentham’s Panopticon**: Surveillance as an automatic, anonymous expression of power (Foucault, 1977).
- Military inspiration flowed into sciences, shaping concepts like **Command, Control, Communications, and Information**.
- Problems of **control engineering** and **communication engineering** became inseparable.
- Post-war trajectory driven by simulations blurred boundaries between:
  - Experiment
  - Instrument
  - Theory

---

## Cybernetics and the Shift to Information
- **Cybernetic Worldview**:
  - Communication as goal-oriented feedback.
  - Blurring boundaries between natural and social sciences.

- **Shannon’s Information Theory**:
  - Defined information as measurable sequences distributed over time.
  - Greater randomness → Less redundancy in communication.
  - Equated entropy with disorder.

- Transition from **sciences of energy** (thermodynamics) to **sciences of information and control**.

---

## Machines and Rationality
- Machines shifted from external sources of power (**clockwork**) to internal principles of regulation (**motors**).
- Machines redefined:
  - **18th century**: Clockwork models.
  - **19th century**: Thermodynamic engines.
  - **20th century**: Information systems (e.g., computers, cybernetics).

- Neoclassical economics favored mechanical simplicity; **cyborg science** embraced complexity and change.

---

## Information and Communication
- Relationship between organisms and environments reframed as communication problems.
- Cybernetic scientists emphasized **basins of attraction** and heuristics over static equilibria.

### Shannon and Thermodynamics
- Shannon’s communication theory derived from thermodynamic entropy:
  - Entropy: A measure of disorder/randomness.
  - Violations of the second law of thermodynamics provided physical interpretations of information.

- **Claude Shannon** and **Norbert Wiener**:
  - Shannon equated entropy with disorder.
  - Wiener saw entropy as oppressive, requiring neutralization.

---

## Evolution of Computing and Economics
- Computers originally referred to human calculators performing mathematical tasks.
- **Charles Babbage** mechanized computation:
  - **Difference Engine**: Arithmetic operations.
  - **Analytical Engine**: First stored-program computer.

- Computing and economics converged:
  - **Marginalist revolution**: Divorced economics from computation.
  - Neoclassical theory emphasized agents’ mental configurations over workplace structures.

---

## Von Neumann and Game Theory
- John von Neumann's contributions:
  - **Game theory**: Mixed strategies introduced randomness but also determinate solutions.
  - Advocated for pre-emptive Cold War strategies.

- Spread of game theory into microeconomics:
  - Axiomatic foundations of **expected utility theory**.
  - Economics as information processing science.

---

## Complexity and Computation
- **Turing Machines** foundational to computational complexity and formal grammars:
  - Defined abstract languages through rule-based production systems.
  - Complexity hierarchies linked to problem tractability.

- Evolution equated to navigating complexity hierarchies through emergent solutions.

---

## Linguistics and Economics
### The Linguistic Sign
- Language as a system of signs:
  - A sign links a **concept** to a **sound pattern**.
  - **Arbitrary signs** better convey the semiological process than symbols, which retain some natural connections.

### Synchronic vs. Diachronic Perspectives
- **Synchronic linguistics**: Studies systems at a single point in time.
- **Diachronic linguistics**: Studies systems as they evolve over time.

---

## Thermodynamics and Information
- **Entropy** in thermodynamics measures disorder; became a metaphor for challenges in economics and biology.
- Shannon’s theory introduced:
  - **Semantically impoverished information**: Focus on quantifiable aspects of communication.
  - Information as the triumph over disorder.

---

## Key Takeaways
1. **Cyborg Science**:
   - Integrates cybernetics, biology, and economics.
   - Emphasizes feedback systems, complexity, and information processing.

2. **Military and Science**:
   - Military advancements inspired theoretical frameworks in control and communication.
   - Simulations and computational techniques blurred the line between natural and social sciences.

3. **Economics and Computing**:
   - Evolution from mechanical to cybernetic models.
   - Game theory and information theory reshaped economic thought.

4. **Entropy and Complexity**:
   - Entropy as a unifying concept across disciplines.
   - Shift from deterministic systems to dynamic, information-driven frameworks.
