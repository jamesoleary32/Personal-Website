# Notes from *The Privatisation of American Science*

## Key Themes
1. **Restructuring of the Corporate Form**
2. **The Role of Offshore Outsourcing in Research**
3. **Withdrawal of the State as a Patron of Science**
4. **The Marketplace of Ideas and Neoliberal Doctrine**
5. **Science and the Linear Model**
6. **Analogies Between Economics and Physics**

## Restructuring of the Corporate Form
- **1980s Trends**:
  - Decrease in firms’ propensity to divest.
  - **Networks of contractors** replaced ownership ties as modes of organization.
  - Labour-intensive heavy manufacturing outsourced to low-wage countries.
  - Shift toward **market coordination** over **managerial hierarchical coordination**.

- Historically, many PhDs were employed in corporate research divisions. The breakdown of the **Chandlerian model** led to the divestment of R&D.
  - Assumes R&D is a fungible commodity with a well-developed market.

---

## Offshore Outsourcing and Research
- A significant proportion of research is now conducted offshore:
  - **Investment banks** outsource financial analysis.
  - **Radiologists in India** interpret U.S. CT scans.
  - **Intel’s China Software Lab** in Shanghai works on software development.

- Transformation of the **American science base**:
  - Offshore outsourcing forms the bulk of **privatized research**.
  - Institutions of globalized, privatized research were pioneered outside academia, as adjuncts to corporate changes.

---

## Withdrawal of the State
- The U.S. federal government’s share of national R&D funding has been falling since **1967**, while private industry’s share has been rising.
- The **Military-Academic Complex** has been slowly unwinding, highlighted by the **Bayh-Dole Act (1980)**:
  - Allowed universities and small businesses to own patents on government-funded discoveries.
  - Part of a broader effort to extricate government from Cold War science management.

### Education and Universities
- Retreat from the idea of the state as the primary provider of education.
- Universities reengineered into **competitive global service industries**, producing "information" and "human capital."
- Shift from student grants to **student loans**, redefining students as consumers.
- **Two-Pronged Objective of U.S. Education Policy**:
  1. Preserve a few private legacy institutions.
  2. Convert the rest of the system to low-cost, for-profit options.

- Research increasingly conducted through **commercialized joint ventures** with external corporations.
- **Blurring of public/private identities** in education and research.

## The Marketplace of Ideas
- Core to **neoliberal doctrine**, with trends such as:
  - The **knowledge economy**.
  - Internet expansion.
  - Strengthening of **intellectual property rights**.
  - Corporate outsourcing of R&D.
  - Withdrawal of state-provided education.

- Neoliberals redefined the market as the ultimate information processor and the **ideal economy** as a "marketplace of ideas."

### Neoliberal Principles
- Markets must be **constructed and maintained**, not left to emerge naturally.
- Freedom redefined as **economic freedom**, subordinating other human actions to competitive market order.
- **Neoclassical economic model** transcends the tension between state and market by reducing both to a **flat ontology**.

- **Corporate Marketization**:
  - Treat knowledge as a market commodity, not the unique possession of employees or social units.

---

## Science and the Linear Model
- The **Linear Model** describes the production of science:
  1. Federal Money → Basic Research → Applied Research → Development → Technology → Application → Social Benefits.

- Demise of the Linear Model:
  - Questioned the idea that science directly causes economic growth.
  - Replaced distinctions between basic/applied research with "technoscience."

- **Bayh-Dole Act** reflects the logic of the public good rationale, decoupling scientific research from education functions.

---

## Analogies Between Economics and Physics
- **Neoclassical Economics** borrowed heavily from physics:
  - Analogies between energy in physics and utility in economics (e.g., Irving Fisher).
  - Conservation principles mirrored in economic models.
  - Macroeconomic instability likened to natural processes in early economics (e.g., Jevons’ sunspots).

- The **Marginalist Revolution** (Walras) introduced concepts like "the law of one price," drawing directly on physical science methodologies.

### Critiques of Neoclassical Economics
- Static rather than dynamic.
- Simplifies complex processes using metaphors and analogies.
- The **market as a supercomputer**: frames information processing as central to economic behavior.

---

## Summary of Key Concepts
1. **Offshore Outsourcing**: Bulk of privatized research conducted abroad.
2. **Neoliberal Market Construction**:
   - Markets treated as artificial constructs.
   - Economic freedom prioritized above all.
3. **Linear Model Decline**: Science-policy paradigms shifted away from traditional models.
4. **Economics and Physics**:
   - Analogies shaped foundational economic theories.
   - Conservation principles reflected epistemological needs in both fields.
