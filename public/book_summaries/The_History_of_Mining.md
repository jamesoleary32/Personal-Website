# Notes from *The History of Mining*

---

## **The Stone Age**
- One of the earliest known mines is **Lion Cave** in Swaziland, Africa, with quarrying activities dating back 60,000 years.

---

## **The Bronze Age**
- **Technological Breakthroughs**:
  - Alloying copper with tin to create bronze for weapons and tools.
  - Parallel mining and use of other metals like lead and zinc.
- **Key Developments**:
  - Writing invented in Mesopotamia during the Early Bronze Age.
  - Metallurgy emerged in **Anatolia (Turkey)**, where tin deposits enabled bronze production.
  - **Fire-setting**: A technique used to break hard rock, such as malachite (copper carbonate ore) in Serbian mines.
  - Knowledge of geological environments helped miners locate flint and other resources.
- **Smelting**:
  - Copper smelting required large amounts of charcoal:
    - 5 cubic meters of wood produced 300kg of charcoal, yielding 1kg of copper.
- **Economic and Environmental Impact**:
  - Significant demand for wood for smelting altered landscapes and ecosystems.

## **The Iron Age**
- **Origins**:
  - Egyptians first used meteoric iron (~4th millennium BC).
  - The Iron Age began with the discovery of conventional iron sources.
- **Processing Iron Ore**:
  - Early method: **Sponge iron**:
    - Iron ore combined with carbon, melted into a spongy mass, and beaten to remove carbon (resulting in wrought iron).
- **Spread**:
  - First iron objects produced in Anatolia before spreading to the Middle East.

---

## **Mining and Water Table**
- **Water Table**:
  - Refers to the underground level where soil or rock is saturated with water.
  - Implications:
    - Shallow water tables benefit agriculture and wells but risk waterlogging and foundation damage.
    - Deeper water tables present challenges for well drilling and mining operations.

---

## **Roman Mining**
- **Economic Importance**:
  - Spanish gold mines significantly financed the Roman Empire.
  - Gold mining production reached over **200,000 oz**, according to Pliny the Elder.
- **Techniques**:
  - Traditional alluvial techniques extracted minerals from river sediments.
  - Larger-scale methods included underground shafts and galleries.

---

## **Medieval Mining (12th–13th Centuries)**
- **Mineral Rights**:
  - Miners in Italy, Germany, and England secured rights to minerals, subject to royalties through legal frameworks like the Treaty of Trent.
- **Mine Financing**:
  - In Germany, mine financing evolved:
    - Non-workers invested in mines, purchasing equity and drawing dividends.
    - This pattern anticipated the modern division of labor between workers and owners.

---

## **Society and Technology**
- **Historical Context**:
  - The **Renaissance** (14th–16th centuries) and the **Reformation** (1517) influenced the rise of Europe.
- **Advances in Mining**:
  - Water power improved pumping and treatment efficiency.
  - Blast furnaces increased smelting throughput significantly.

---

## **Evolution of Mining Techniques**
- **Deeper Mining**:
  - Pursuit of high-grade orebodies at depth required **de-watering**, initially done manually.
- **Gunpowder**:
  - Introduced in the 17th century, replacing fire-setting for breaking ore.

## **Notable Mining Regions**
### **Sweden**:
- **Falun Copper Mine**:
  - Active since the 11th century, it became the oldest recorded joint stock company in 1288.
  - By the 17th century, responsible for **70% of the world’s copper output**, fueling Gustavus Adolphus’ European conquests.

### **France**:
- **Gypsum Deposits**:
  - Montmartre gypsum deposits led to the creation of **plaster of Paris**.
- **Parisian Catacombs**:
  - Resulted from Middle Ages mining activities beneath the city.
