Is there any differences between monetary usages of peasants vs other merchants?

The size of individual transactions is necessarily small 
Their exchanges would not have occurred at a consistent level of frequency but would exhibit a temporal bias due to the seasonality of agricultural activity 

Distinction: are monetary transactions conducted seasonally or constantly 

Monetary demand among peasants is generated locally, those among merchants with no confinement to a region

Four quadrants of exchange:
Named/Distant: Bills of exchange
Anonymous/Distant: Large Currency 

Named/Proximate: Bookkeeping 
Anonymous/Proximate: Small currency 

Exchange & Institutional Setting

Social system based on mutual gifts: custom economy 
System of exchange:                          market economy 
System of redistribution:                      order economy
