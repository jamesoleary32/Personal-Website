# Crypto gaming: An Incremental Innovation


### Abstract

This article discusses crypto game design in the context of the evolution of gaming monetisation structures. A core thesis is that the development of crypto games has so far tended to neglect learning from the history of traditional game design and that there are learnings to be had from existing games’ approaches to user-generated content, economic sustainability, and reward design. Subsequent articles will deal more directly with the material economics, whilst this sets the context for that discussion.

### Introduction

In a virtual space sim, a single in-game war has led to the [destruction of over $700,000 of value](https://www.ign.com/articles/how-eve-onlines-players-started-a-war-thats-cost-700k). Does this sound like crypto? Well it’s not, it’s EVE Online, a game that was released in 2003. It’s important to appreciate the complexity of MMO Economies so we can avoid reinventing the wheel in the development of web3 games. The space epic EVE Online is often used as a case study on the potential scale of gaming economies. They even go so far as to publish a [monthly review of its in-game economy](https://www.eveonline.com/news/view/monthly-economic-report-march-2022), providing statistics on the flows of resources in their game. Compared to most web2 games EVE seems to stand apart in its complexity, often referred to as ‘spreadsheets in space’. This may be true, but it neglects a number of MMORPG games with thriving economies, often discussed in the context of play-to-earn is Runescape, where cash-rich, time-poor players pay cash-poor, time-rich players to grind out base-level resources. Preceding the play-2-earn frenzy of Axie by over a decade was [World of Warcraft gold farming](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2009/mar/05/virtual-world-china), and a year before Axie’s ascendancy, Runescape came to the fore providing a [lifeline to Venezuelans](https://www.polygon.com/features/2020/5/27/21265613/runescape-is-helping-venezuelans-survive) that were being brutalised by hyperinflation, a phenomena that had occurred for years but is interesting in the context of Axie serving a similar role in the Philippines.

To not neglect their differences, I see a key difference between games like World of Warcraft, Runescape and others, and Axie as the way that these emergent phenomena are expressly interpreted by the game developers. In Runescape, these Venezuelans farming in-game currency were breaking the terms and conditions of the game, at risk of having their accounts shut down, whilst in Axie this activity was embraced by the game developers and the community surrounding the game. Evangelists of Play-2-Earn gaming present this development as a new paradigm, which could from another perspective be interpreted as more of a subtle high-level legal-cultural development than a change to the underlying complex system.

In this article I’ll be discussing the relationship between MMO economics and crypto-economics; what the development of crypto games materially means for the player experience, the implications of crypto gaming for user-generated content, some of the clever thoughts from the GameFi space, and finally what lessons we can learn from F2P Economy design.

### What really is a game economy?

A game economy may refer to the production and drain of resources within a game or the nexus of exchange interactions between different agents. Formally one could express a game economy in terms of a set of initial conditions which are evolved by players and their possible actions. Single-player games do have their own economies but are much more predictable, and much less complex than multiplayer games because of the insane complexity of human interaction. Virtual gaming economies are much like the real economy, but with specific types of constraints, for instance, in a virtual economy one doesn’t have to worry about overconsuming resources (unless that’s programmed in!). Game economies face similar issues to real economies, a very common concern being inflation. So for this article, our primary focus will be on multiplayer games.

A discussion about an economy is a discussion about a complex system, so it’s necessary to recognise some of the features of working with complex systems. There is significant difficulty in interpreting complex systems by measuring their variable outputs, as these reductive linear metrics tend to lack a deeper causal relevance, even if they’re analytically interesting as the input to a higher-order system. What is more compelling in the context of the base game is measuring persistent inputs, and what factors are largely invariant. What does this mean for gaming? This means measuring and understanding changes to our initial conditions, rather than just a narrow focus on the emergent property such as the level of inflation in the game. This is a generally applicable approach and will be discussed in another article.

In the context of Footium (the perspective I’m approaching research from), there are a number of different initial conditions that need to be considered. These include ensuring a fair distribution of player ratings in the game(power creep); how do we ensure clubs’ academies are generating a balanced mix of players, how to make the distribution of prizes make sense, and how to price signing a player from your academy etc. All these issues can be broken down into two parts, their initial conditions and the rules which govern their evolution.

For example, when thinking about clubs’ academies the questions are: what is the base quality of an academy, how do club owners improve their club, and to what extent will improvements compound over time? Does this undermine balance? These questions concern balance and the scope for a monetisation that isn’t antagonistic to the player base. Moving forward it’s interesting to think about the spectrum of existing approaches to monetisation.

### Product Games and Service Games

A dichotomy in gaming monetisation, and management economics, is that of product and services, in gaming this is product-games and service-games, conceptually the product-services dichotomy is blurry but it’s a useful framework for interpreting different approaches. Product games have the ambiguous impact of front-loading the studio’s revenue, these studios are biassed towards optimising for hype and people buying the game, which has the unintended side-effect of the chance of coming at the expense of a fun experience. The institutional development of free-to-play has provided new models for gaming monetization.

In the [Pyramid of Game Design](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Pyramid-Game-Design-Designing-Producing/dp/1138298999) (highly recommended!) Nicholas Lovell describes the fundamental difference between Product and service games. With product games, the studio receives their revenue before the player has confirmed they have enjoyed their experience. Although online reviews may mitigate this information asymmetry in product games it still persists ([think about pre-ordering a game to be let down](https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/22/22195728/cyberpunk-2077-sales-copies-sold-launch-refunds#:~:text=Because%20the%20studio%20promised%20the,cycle%20in%20single%2Dday%20sales.)), particularly in the presence of massive distortionary advertising spending. Conversely, service games don’t book the sale at the point of download, instead of providing a game that allows players who enjoy the game to be monetised by their desire to get more deeply involved with the game. Key Performance Indicators like Daily Active Users (DAUs) and Average Revenue Per User (ARPU) became more interesting in the context of Free-to-Play as it’s a proxy for how engaged a game’s community is, and one’s expected future revenue. in product games the revenue accrual is front-loaded whilst in service games revenue accrues over time depending upon engagement and retention.

### My experiences researching web2 & web3 economies

Web3 gaming conversations have been dominated by the play-2-earn since Axie’s Giga success in 2021. Axie, with its hundreds of thousands of DAUs, felt like a true proof of concept for the value of blockchain for the gaming world. Swiftly, organisations like [Yield Guild Games](https://yieldguild.io/) emerged as intermediaries to facilitate the matching of gamers with game assets, I’ll extend this discussion later when considering the evolving role of user-generated content. Crypto Gaming is obviously still not mainstream and games like Axie, are in a recession at the moment, following their 2021 boom.

As discussed earlier, the monetisation funnel in product games is basically, that you buy the game, you play the game. In service games, the collection of revenue is temporally distributed conditional on the game being materially compelling to its users. In NFT gaming it’s basically you buy the game, either from the developers themselves or on a liquid secondary market, try playing the game, if it sucks you dump the NFT. If you enjoy the game you carry on holding, retaining access to the game with the scope to engage more deeply as the game progresses. So the game pass itself is variably priced! Sure we already segment the market through DLCs, expansion content, microtransactions, etc… All those concepts are already developed, but this implicit variable pricing of the base-level of gameplay and with the scope to stop playing the game at no net cost, (or maybe even a profit!), to the player is new. From the buyer’s perspective, we can reinterpret buying a game from being an expense to buying an asset! From the game studio’s perspective, one has to make a great game because not doing so means that one shouldn’t be able to sell more first copies of the game as dissatisfied players with poor expectations can just dump their game passes onto the market. NFTs being unique assets can be priced according to their attributes which may be intrinsic or a function of how it’s been used within the context of a game. In a multiplayer game, where the value of a game pass may be a reflection of players’ energy and skill, then unlockable content can be generated by one player and sold to another.

As mentioned earlier, most non-web3 games place strict limits on what the player can do with their game outside the context of the game itself, this places some restrictions on the scope of the metagame. In earlier forms of gaming, the community has often been a big component, an inextricable part of multiplayer gaming, massive conferences like [E3](https://e3expo.com/) and [Insomnia](https://insomniagamingfestival.com/) show how much gamers like to talk about gaming outside of actually gaming. An adage in crypto is that community is your moat, something typically interpreted as a consequence of how low friction the space is to move about in. For gaming, once assets are liquid and tradeable outside of the game, then everyone involved in NFT gaming who enjoys their game they have an added incentive to get their friends on board to evangelise their game. In crypto gaming, demand is temporally bound to the duration of time that people have, expect to have or expect other people to have, fun in the game. Many crypto games need persistent demand, and trade volume for their business model to make sense. Recurring demand is important for aligning the incentive of games studios with their customers because they need to be constantly innovating to keep the game fun.

A key aspect of the business model of many crypto games is the revenue generated from taxes on the in-game marketplace. Whilst the idea of a game’s financing being supported by an in-game marketplace isn’t new, games like [Diablo III](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHgZ2YQOgso) introduced an in-game marketplace that taxed in-game transactions. For this to make sense the game and its mechanics need to be aligned with the business model. In Diablo III, the marketplace was closed soon after due to the backlash from the player base that perceived the move as a cash grab and the way the core game mechanics conflicted with the efficiency of an in-game economy.

### What are the material developments?

The Web2 relationship with property rights is obviously different from web3 where in-game assets are liquid and traded on the market. Although games do sell cosmetics, in-game assets, upgrades, etc.. These are stored on the game’s server and verifying ownership outside the context of the game is non-trivial.

Comparing a traditional game economy and a crypto game economy side-by-side we see the main difference we’re faced with is the technical implementation of the assets’ ownership and the consequences for property rights. Projects like [Loot](https://www.lootproject.com/) are explicitly framed as a system of lore, a property that is implicit in many projects that position themselves wishing to be part of a metaverse.

In our web2 economy, a centralised database is mapping objects to particular owners, providing rules about how these assets are exchanged within this ecosystem, and whether they even can be exchanged.

Starting from a point of property rights, gamers in a web2 economy tend to own nothing other than the right to use the asset within the context of the game at the discretion of the game developers. Gamers in a web3 economy own these underlying assets, assets implemented according to the [ERC-721 standard](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/2.x/erc721#:~:text=ERC721%20is%20a%20standard%20for,accross%20a%20number%20of%20contracts.) have particular standard characteristics that imply the possibility of interoperability with other ecosystems.

What do these property rights even mean in the context of a crypto game? Most crypto games are still operated in a largely centralised way, the perceived cost associated with running complex logic on-chain is prohibitive for most games opting to run their game on their own centralised servers. These game developers are gatekeepers, controlling the flow of information from the blockchain into their game, and gamers still trust that it’s not in the developer’s interest to modify the game at their expense.

Having spoken with a number of gaming guilds there has been a welcome shift in perspective from play-2-earn to play-and-earn. Recognising that a game economy is about allowing players within a game to express different preferences rather than being the game itself.

### User-Generated Content

In web3, many games studios, mine included, signal to gamers that they will be able to have commercial rights over the game’s assets. In the context of some games, this is an awesome possibility. The increasing pop cultural significance of gaming means that to have the right over these assets is both an opportunity to materially profit from one’s contribution and legitimise accomplishments. However, at the moment, I interpret the amorphous vision of user-generated content and a creator economy as a crutch for those that don’t have the know-how or resources to actually make diverse base gameplay.

When thinking about UGC I think about two types: the in-game content and the out-of-game content. In-game user-generated content may extend the base-level gameplay, what objects one has in this virtual world, whilst external UGC is people making entertaining or informative content using a game’s assets.

#### Internal UGC

Roblox in many ways has been the ultimate kids’ metaverse for a number of years, almost all content is created by the community. I remember having a friend that was earning Robux from his in-game car dealership, ~8 years ago. Effectively he had built these car assets and scripted these assets’ logic using the Roblox toolkit. It was really cool. [Generating $1.9bn of revenue in 2021 alone](https://ir.roblox.com/news/news-details/2022/Roblox-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-2021-Financial-Results/default.aspx), its reach and scope are growing rapidly. The deal for the creators isn’t great, everything is ultimately owned by the Roblox platform and the creators undoubtedly aren’t capturing an efficient amount of their value generation.

Games like loot are UGC taken to its logical conclusion. All that is engaging exists at the hands of the community. Spawning a number of similar projects.

Crypto doesn’t solve all problems, for instance, The Sandbox’s approach may be interpreted as antithetical to the spirit of crypto. On the Sandbox by [uploading an Asset to The Sandbox, you agree never to publish the Asset elsewhere](https://www.sandbox.game/en/terms-of-use/). Playing devil’s advocate, in reality, what scope is there for interoperability? It’s currently not at a place where interoperability can be seamless. Different projects using different tech stacks imply a technical bottleneck towards true interoperability. And whether we’ll ever see it is a different question, the development of Meta’s approach to the metaverse and the persistence of the insularity of the Apple ecosystem may suggest interoperability isn’t inevitable.

#### External UGC

The other side of User Generated Content is the content that people create about the game, not content that’s actually in the game itself. Twitch, Youtube Let’s Plays and much more illustrate the massive appetite for this kind of content creation. This type of content is entertaining as well as useful as a marketing channel.

Many gaming companies have a structured approach to encouraging this type of content. For instance, Roblox has a [creator program](https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/en-us/articles/360026092011-Roblox-Video-Stars-Program) that provides creators making Roblox-related content with the incentives to create content, similar to many crypto projects’ community funds. The upside of owning NFTs is the possibility for communities that actually turn brands into cultural phenomena and the chance of reaping the upside.

On a random note, one of my personal favourite creators, [FitMC](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=fitmc) discusses the (honestly awesome) dynamics of the 2b2t, the oldest anarchy server in Minecraft. This analysis which is similar in its nuance to a discussion about real wars and real economies is epic even thoughts it’s just a single server played by only a few hundred people at any given time maps back to the earlier discussion about not underestimating the scale of interaction within existing gaming economies.

**Next time**

The next article will be about the specific approaches to building the economies in gaming systems in the context of these different emergent aspects of gaming.
