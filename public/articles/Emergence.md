# The Definitive Introduction to  Emergence

## Introduction
Crucially emergence refers to something that is objectively irreducible. If an entity is irreducible it means that it cannot be losslessly explained in terms of its components. 
You may hear people talk about how some property emerges given some parts or inputs, in gaming we might talk about 
emergent behaviour  when users do things that weren't explicitly planned by the developer. The behaviour of the users in such a case 
would be deemed irreducible to the game's mechanics. I even used it in my article about how *Web3 provides a foundation for the emergence of a higher order of sophistication in games and virtual worlds*, with that I was kind of trying to say that Web3 is a condition that facilitates certain patterns of behaviour but that its mere existence is not the full enabling condition. 

## The motivation to write about this
My first interaction with emergence was when I was about 14 and came across **[Conway's Game of Life](https://playgameoflife.com/)**. In Conway's Game of Life, the player is responsible for setting the initial conditions of a recursive simulation, in English, you have a grid of cells, each cell is either in an on or an off state and for each cell depending upon the states of its neighbours its state updates or it doesn't, as the user you set the initial states of the cells on this grid, and then you start the simulation. At which point the rule is applied the states recursively update until they converge on some end state. Conway's Game of Life is Turing Complete, which means that through setting the initial states of these cells one can simulate any algorithmic process - how can something so trivially simple generate such complexity.  

When I was at university I studied economics, and part of that was a fairly orthodox introduction to micro-economics. The analytical unit of Orthodox micro is the utility-maximiising individual. I imagine very few economists claim that society and its complexity is fully explained by elaboration and manipulation of such an analytical unit, I shall call this methodology one of *micro-reductionism*, in contrast, in sociology society was taken as the unit of analysis and people were taken to be products of society, this methodology is one of *macro-reductionism*. I thought that was an interesting thing to observe. I do think that one can have a reductive (necessarily?) model and still generate useful predictions! 

In stark contrast, in my second year of university I read **Stephen Wolfram's [A New Kind of Science](https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/)**, where, amongst other things, he studies and categorises various types of cellular automata, at the start of the book showing how with a (super simple) 1-dimensional cellular automata, through simulation, one can generate different classes of complex behaviour. This made me think about what are the limits of this idea of emergence, who has thought about it rigorously, and applied it generally, which is how I cam across Carl Gillet and Manuel De Landa. 

## Why study emergence for people interested about the world
An awareness of emergent phenomena is essential to the explicability of the world. Closely related, the concept of emergence is closely tied to thinking about different levels of abstraction and different types of explanations, those being, ***intra-level compositional explanations*** as we're using entities within a single level of abstraction for our explanation, and ***inter-level explanaitons*** in which entities from difference levels of abstractiona are used in an explanation. 

If an entity is referred to by our best explanation in the relevant field then we must regard it as really existing. Everyday events are intractably 
complex when expressed in terms of their fundamental physics. 

Some of that complexity resolves itself into higher-level simplicity. 
For water to be useful we don't need to understand why in terms of the movements of its molecules, we understand water in terms of some high-level properties, a specifically interesting one being temperature. Using the *Kinetic theory of gases*, the *temperature of the ideal gas is proportional to the average kinetic energy of its particles*. We have this property temperature which we take to objectively exist as it forms the basis of various explanations for phenomena in the natural world. Temperature is an emergent property of the water. 

For example, we can predict how long it will take for water to boil assuming we only know quantities that are easy to measure. 
But if we think about it temperature is really very complex, 

There is a class of high-level phenomena that can be well explained in terms of each other alone, remember our ***intra-level compositional explanation*** 

This is tied closely to the idea ***Asymptotic Stability***, this concept refers to how the properties of a whole i.e high-level properties are considered stable if the emergent properties can survive changes in the details in the interactions between its parts. In other words, a stable emergent property is indifferent to local chanes in the interactions that give rise to it, and this *objective indifference* translates into an *objective explanatory irrelevance* of the details of the interaction.

The behaviour of high-level physical quantities consists of nothing but the behaviour of their low-level constituents with most the detials being ignored. 
Humans had only heuristics, and these heuristics were about high-level regularities among emergent phenomena 

Emergence is responsible for the fact that discoveries can be made in successive steps, thus providing scope for the scientific method. The partial succe


## Emergent Properties, Capacities/Tendencies &  Properties 
### Capacities vs Properties 
A kitchen knife may be sharp or not, sharpness is an objective property 
However the capacity to cut doesn't exist unless it is being actualised. 
We have a clear ontological difference between capacities and properties, the capacity is contingent on the existence of other objects. 
The capacity to cut things depends on the property of being sharp.

## Parts and Wholes
I tink a good way to approach thinking about emergence is through the lens of *parts* and *wholes*. When we have our parts and wholes we're 
immediately faced with the question: is the whole different to its parts. Its quite a subtle question, of course the whole is different to the parts, 
thats why we're interested in the whole and we've invented a word to describe it  

**The Scientific reductionist view:** Wholes are nothing but their parts.

**The Emergentist view:** Wholes are more than the sum of their parts. 

**A modern take on Emergentism:** Parts behave differently in wholes. 

At the crux of these different perspectives are divergent ontological commitments. 

Different types of reductionism **semantic reductionism**, **everyday reductionism**, **greedy reductionism**.

## Epistemology of Emergence 

## Ontology of Emergence 
What type of entities display this characteristic of "irreducible whole"?
We don't want to construct a philosophy based on concrete wholes, or reified generalities, more simply, i.e. we don't necessarily want to arbitrarily treat 
abstract concepts as if they have some real basis 

## Simulations and the Tractability of Emergence
Emergence becomes tangible in the context of computer simulations, with computers its very easy to compute the result from recursively conducting a calculation a large number of times.
