# Why Footium
Why of all the things I could spend my time on, am I high conviction in Footium specifically. I am doing this in the style of Roelof Botha's internal memo motivating the Sequoia investment into Youtube. 


## Investment Summary

**Business**
- Footium's goal is to become the definitive operator of real-money Football Simulations. The company currently has a tech stack to conduct >3000 simulations daily at a price of 0.07 per simulation. They are currently spending 10,000 monthly on AWS 
- Millions of consumers love incumbent Football Manager, it is the game with the highest average playtime on Steam, in spite of the lack of meaningful innovation over the last decade. 
- This is not a fantasy sports play, fantasy products derive from real-world events whilst 

- Blockchain is a platform shift that allows any developer to straightforwardly introduce real-money into their gaming, the unique insight from Footium has been the observation that users love social roleplay in sports and that the real-money buy-in generates the sunkl c. 

- There are 10million+ consumers that monetise upfront to purchase from Football Manager, an incumbent game that has been selling yearly releases now into its third decade. 
- Top Eleven, a multiplayer Football Manager has >250m lifetime downloads for its non-IP based Football Management game. 


**Market**

**Competition**
- Incumbents: Football Manager, Top Eleven, Hattrick
- New Entrants: Metaverse Football League, Soccerverse, SimWin
- Indirect Competitors: Ultimate Champions, Sorare

## Competition 
There are several potential and direct competitors to Footium. 

### 1. Incumbent Competition 
The two scaled incumbent competitors are Football Manager and Top Eleven. 
- **Football Manager** is developed by Sports Interactive based in the UK. They position themselves as "[the] Unrivalled series of football management simulation video games."
- **Top Eleven** was started by Nordeus out of Serbia. They launched their product in 2010 and rode the Facebook social graph as the mode for multiplayer online gaming during the early-mid 2010s. 

### 2. New Entrants 
There are a number of startups that sought to build a blockchain-integrated Football Management, notably is Metaverse Football League and Soccerverse, however there are several startups that have already exited the space including  

- **Metaverse Football League** has raised an undisclosed amount of funding from undisclosed investors, however they will have needed outside funding to support their current team. They were slower to deploy however were quicker to soft-launch their product 

- **Soccerverse** has cumulatively raised $4m, having recently raised $3.1m for Square Enix the games publisher (announced July 2024). The founder Andy is the former CEO of Invincibles Studio - the developer of the Soccer Manager franchise of games. They have taken the approach of putting all the game logic on-chain - its not obvious if the product is client-agnostic, or if that even matters. They're yet to push any marketing or meaningful distribution. They use real-world IP in the game however 

### 3. Indirect Competitors 
There are a number of startups operating in the real-money sports gaming space creating NFT-based fantasy sports, 

- **Sorare** They have ~4m signups and ~400,000 unique NFT holders. They conducted the largest Series-B in Europe ($680m) in 2021 at the top of the Web3 bubble, with which they became exclusive holders of a wide suite of sports rights covering IP for NFTs. They started in 2019 and had a core Web3 audience achieving $20m GMV from 4,000 users with $5,000 average GMV. They developed a F2P product however its unclear.

- **Ultimate Champions** They have ~10,000 unique NFT holders. They have cumulatively raised $9m with investors including Binance Labs. They recently released their UNA token to what can only be categorised as a failure. They have a F2P product its unclear how many users they have.

## The Technology Infrastructure 

## Vision 
### Beyond Blockchain
Reductively, on the face of it the vision is shared across all the block-chain based entrants attacking the space i.e. blockchain serves as a back-end for real-money trading. 
However Footium sees that the true promise of blockchain is in fitting into a strategy of building a parallel virtual world of football, users are motivated to create content and flesh out the reality of this virtual world. Ultimately Footium believes that the real-world of football can be subordinated by the virtual world.
