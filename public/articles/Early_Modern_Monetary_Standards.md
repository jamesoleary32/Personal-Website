## The Evolution of Monetary Standards in the Early Modern Period

date: 2022-04-26


**Introduction**

Chinese trade with The West was historically a one-sided relationship. The West, impressed by the quality of craftsmanship, gained a taste for Chinese goods, whilst Western traders quickly found the Chinese had no appetite for their wares, traders insisting that for the Chinese, _silver is blood_. Silver was the money of the world, and had been the chief global monetary metal for millenia. There was already trade between continents, the silk road had been developed whilst Europe was united under the Romans. Europe was the most westward terminus on this silk road, most trade between China and Europe occurring indirectly.

During the early modern period European powers were on the ascent, developing their expansive aspirations. Spain and Portugal were locked in a race to expand their empires. In 1488, Bartolomeu Dias, a Portuguese navigator who sailed around the Cape of Good Hope, caused a Sputnik Crisis for Spain, who was shocked by the advances of the Portuguese. The Spanish doubled down on their global exploration, funding an Italian explorer and navigator by the name of Christopher Columbus in his quest to find a faster route to India. Columbus’ left for India but actually came to discover America, this discovery laid the foundation for Spanish colonisation,

**Supply and Demand**

In 1545 a native Peruvian by the name of Diego Huallpa discovered the world’s largest silver deposit at the _Cerro de Potosí._ Within a year thousands of Spanish and indigenous prospectors rushed to _Cerro Rico_, Spanish American mines. In particular those at _Potosí,_ quickly became a focal point of world silver production, the source of 60% of all silver mined in the world by the end of the 16th century. The direct-smelting ore was largely exhausted by 1565, leading to a collapse in silver production. Fortunately, this New silver-dominated World was also home to burgeoning innovation and silver production was revived by a cutting-edge technique known as the patio process which used amalgamation. In this process pulverised ore would be mixed with mercury, dissolving the metal, the metal-mercury mixture was heated, evaporating the mercury, leaving the metal. This technique allowed miners to cheaply refine lower grade ores. The Spanish were importing mercury from mines at Almaden, Spain, until the rediscovery of mercury deposits at Huancavelica, known as the _Mina de la muerte_. The discovery of this abundant silver deposit, and mercury for its refinement, facilitated the growth of Spanish America as the heart of global silver production, shifting the global power balance.

.

The metal contained in these mines technically belonged to the Spanish Crown but the mining itself was performed by the colonists and enslaved indigenous people. The Crown took a twenty percent royalty on all that was produced. In 1535 a royal decree authorised the opening of a mint, the Mint of Mexico. Much of the silver produced would be directly minted into coins rather than shipped as bullion. These mints were originally opened due to the demand for coinage to facilitate commerce. In 1572 another mint was established near _Potosí_, now the National Mint of Bolivia. The Spanish Peso was highly valued for high standards in production and a stable silver content. The Peso itself became an export product becoming ubiquitous in global trade, traders could form consistent expectations about the value of the money they were using. With the resources coupled with the production capability, Spain set the global monetary standard, Spanish coinage flowing from their colonies to China, Europe and even British colonies. The supremacy of the Spanish Peso was shown when Elizabeth minted coins, known as Portcullis coins, for the first voyage of the East India Company, These coins weren’t deemed acceptable at their arrival in the Indies as foreign traders were used to dealing exclusively in Spanish coins, subsequently the English East India company primarily dealt in Spanish Reals.

The chief anchor of this massive trade was China, their demand driven by changes to their monetary system. The Chinese had invented paper money and integrated it into their economy centuries earlier; the first promissory note appeared during the Song Dynasty. Western records of Chinese paper money go back to the famous Venetian merchant and explorer Marco Polo, during his travels around the world; described what he saw in a chapter in his book titled _How the Great Khan Causes the Bark of Trees, Made into Something Like Paper, to Pass for Money All over His Country_. However, like the typical story with paper money mismanagement, counterfeiting, and overissuance led to its demise and disappearance from circulation in a protracted process from the middle of the fifteenth century. The reaction was to reintroduce silver as the primary store of value and fiduciary medium. From the 1570s the Chinese state simplified the tax system, in the process shifting the unit of payment from rice to silver. With a quarter of the world obliged to secure silver monies to pay their taxes the global hunger for silver increased drastically_._ In addition to its size China was the most advanced and developed economy in the world, exporting high quality goods globally, however they lacked domestic silver mining. When China introduced these monetary changes, the relative scarcity of silver combined with its absolute importance for taxes, meant the Chinese priced silver far above the rest of the world.

The Spanish were the primary suppliers of this monetary metal in the nexus of global trade. In 1571 Spain founded Manila, quickly becoming a key conduit for Eastern trade with European powers and their colonies. The Manilla Galleon, the ships that ran the trade route from Manila to Mexico, came to be known as the _Chinese ships_ as they carried Chinese luxuries back from exchange for the New World’s silver. Spanish silver mines were exorbitantly profitable as they had the opportunity to fetch a much higher price for their product than if they were just sending it back to Europe. This opening of trade between nations that priced the same asset differently recalibrated money not as something defined by the will of the sovereign but as varying with the market value of the money, and historical relationships between gold and silver were destroyed.

Silver was both a money and a commodity. As a commodity, its supply and demand varied across the world leading it to command different prices, however its commodity status would become antagonistic with its role as a money. Shortage of coinage in Europe in the late 15th and early 16th century, undermined trade as it meant that money itself was scarce. Before paper money and fiat money, the expansion of the official money supply could only be attained through mining or through debasement of the coinage, however debasement was ineffective in the context of international occurring trade. Monetary policy was conducted through modifications to the mint price, the rate at which people could coin currency from their bullion. An important lever for influencing a country’s economy was its coinage, the quality and quantity, or lack thereof, influenced domestic and international trade. The massive influx of new coinage into circulation led to a fall in the value of silver, similar to the printing of more money, setting forth what is known as the _Price Revolution,_ a series of economic events that lead to increases in the price level of many European countries.

Spanish America had been trading with China since the inception of the Manila Galleons in 1573. However, years of supply had been nudging down the relative price of silver in China, until in 1635 an equilibrium started to bite and the Chinese were valuing their silver near equal to Spain. This new equilibrium represented an end to the massive arbitrage profits, and a sudden collapse in the profitability of Spanish mines which could no longer expect to make a lot of profit from merely shipping their silver to The East. This shift operated in the context of an increasingly Northern centre of power, with the Dutch and their East India Company having increasing control of the Southeast Asian trade. The Dutch and English East India Companies had been founded at the beginning of the seventeenth century, scaling in a way not seen before outside of state entities. Global trade had only grown in significance as heavily populated continents started to engage in continuous trade, facilitated by global shipping and innovations. However it wasn’t just silver that commanded a greater price outside China than in the domestic market, Chinese silks were priced far higher in foreign markets than domestically. Traders’ scope for arbitrage was multidimensional, manifesting in silver and particular chinese luxuries.

**European Coinage & The Glorious Revolution**

European monetary history was permeated by a lack of low denomination currency, with frequent historical mention of shortages of small change. Coinage is useful in its predictability, even if it serves only to package a weight and fineness of silver its form as a coin was useful. Coinage was also legal tender, meaning that one could pay taxes in it. Bad coins, even if trade is being made for the underlying metal, can disrupt trade. Debasements have occurred frequently throughout history, famous during the Roman empire which slowly, and then rapidly, reduced the silver content in the denarius. During the reign of King Henry VIII significant reductions in silver standards, and increases to seigniorage were introduced with the intent to finance his expensive wars and lifestyle. During the period of 1542 to 1551 the silver content of the pound sterling fell by 83%. When the new debased coins entered circulation they were quickly recognised as inferior, with people quickly distinguishing between the earlier coins and the debased coins when trading, trading was conducted primarily for the coins’ intrinsic metal content rather than their legal tender value.

When Elizabeth came to the throne she inherited the legacy of her father’s Great Debasement, the legacy of undermined confidence in the coinage, hampered England’s foreign trade. During the beginning of Queen Elizabeth’s reign one of the first matters she dealt with was how to reform the coin, moving to withdraw what was debased. At the beginning of the 17th century, in 1601 under a commission run by Richard Martin, the Master of the Mint, it was decreed that a pound weight of old standard silver was to be coined into three pound sterling and two shillings. This decree set a standard for the mint price of silver, which lasted until 1816.

In England 1615 the silver sixpence and gold unite were declared legal tender_,_ the numeraire was still silver, gold floating. Both metals were recognised as legal tender and the Royal Mint would take in bullion and mint it for a fee given by the cost of production (brassage) and seigniorage. The issue with the fee for minting was that the brassage biassed the production coinage towards those coins of higher value, as the ratio of the actual cost of minting to the face value of the coin meant that the mint could generate more profit from minting higher denomination coinage. This influenced the kinds of coins coming into circulation, smaller coins that were proportionally more expensive suffered a lack as there was less incentive to mint them.

Monetary innovation was bottlenecked by unsophisticated minting technology. Most coinage was being made through the ancient technique of hammering. First the metal would be refined to an acceptable purity before being prepared into sheets, and then striking the upper die with a hammer imprinting the image on both sides. The issue with coins being produced in this way was that they didn’t have a regular diameter, and were vulnerable to being clipped. These irregular diameters meant that people could shave metal off the edge without the debasement being particularly perceptible. Innovations including milling, the introduction of a ridged edge that would make it easy to observe clipping as the ridges and text engraving would be lost.

In 1662 King Charles II England introduced machinery into minting; in an effort to curtail coin clipping. The expense of recoining the entire stock of money undermined the effort with only a minority of the coins in circulation being milled, the state of English coinage hadn’t meaningfully been improved as the existing coins were left in circulation. Compounding the issue with the money many people had the necessary tools for counterfeiting, making it difficult to work against. The most common counterfeiting method was casting coins out of fake moulds and stamping them with counterfeit dies.

A monetary turning point was when in 1663 England introduced a new coin, the guinea, which in 1670 was fixed in weight at 44 and a half guineas per troy pound of gold.The reasoning behind this rate was that the pound of gold if cut into 44 and a half pieces would provide guineas that would pass at £1 a piece, also known as the 20 shilling piece. Rating the guineas at £1 overvalued gold relative to other countries, and undervalued silver. Although it was illegal, English silver coins were being melted down and exported abroad where they commanded a higher value, the prohibition on export of bullion has been common throughout history, contemporary China has its own controls on the movement of precious metals as part of its wider capital controls. This mispricing could only have exacerbated the intense hard currency issues and shortages of seventeenth century England. These shortages were driven by the foreign export of English silver as trade was being done for a weight of metal, not merely the face value of the coin. The debasement of English coinage and concerns about standards led to silver coinage trading at discount relative to gold, people would have to pay a premium if they wished to pay in silver coin as the wear, a phenomena later observed in Spain.

In 1688 a group of English elites invited William and Mary of Holland to invade England. These wealthy London merchants displeased with James’ II economic policies sought King William to fix England’s economic problems, a key point of concern being the chronic monetary shortages. Upon taking the throne, William of Orange brought England into the nine-years war. This war in the context of a weak economic environment placed unprecedented demand on the state. The export of bullion overseas accelerated, and endemic clipping and counterfeiting during the 1690s led foreign markets to stop accepting English silver at face value. For years the treasury was accepting the coins at their face value — not their intrinsic value, but because the foreign war was being financed through the outflow of specie, they couldn’t rely on debased coinage. Years of debasement had reduced circulating coins’ average silver content to little over half their original mint weight. This reduced volume of silver represented a major shortfall in the treasury’s revenue.

Correlated with the currency debasement, British coinage was flowing abroad, as the value that could be had from trade exceeded its value domestically, Britain’s closest trading partner, the Netherlands, priced silver bullion higher. British merchants and goldsmiths would ship bullion to the Amsterdam exchange where they would receive an amount of gold that would exceed that amount of gold one could get by exchanging it at the Royal Mint. This arbitrage market was changing the monetary order, however prices shifted at a far slower rate than one would observe on a modern financial market, during the eighteenth century the regular mail service from London to Amsterdam left only once per week. This reduced volume of currency hampered domestic trade, the flow of currency abroad was interpreted by the prevailing mercantilist philosophy as a loss of economic power. The lack of coin weakened the state’s capacity to project its power overseas, as projecting power overseas required the remittance of bullion

These economic crises provided the impetus for a close examination of the currency, and a commission of distinguished scholars, including Christopher Wren, John Locke and Isaac Newton, were put together to come up with a solution. Locke, the eminent seventeenth English social philosopher, saw the government’s role as enforcing its property rights, mandated to provide for its citizens confidence in its currency. In 1691 a 5% reduction in the weight of silver coins was suggested, prompting Locke to enter the conversation with an anonymous pamphlet. His pamphlet, entitled _Some Considerations of the Consequences of the Lowering of Interest and the Raising the Value of Money_ touched on the proposal to lower the interest rate, and the proposal to alter the standard of silver money, both of which Locke strongly opposed To John Locke, the state’s primary role was to protect property rights, and restoring confidence in its currency aligned with that philosophy. Locke proposed that new silver coins should continue to be of the weight and fineness decreed in 1601. Early 1696 the plans for the great recoinage went through parliament with the _Act for Remedying the Ill State of the Coin of the Kingdom_ that clipped coins would cease to be considered legal tender or used for tax payments. An aspect of the proposal was the point that those suffering the losses shouldn’t be compensated. This was contested by other contemporary thinkers such as Charles Montagu and William Lowndes.

The government decided to remint coins according to the original, 1601 specification. The Great Recoinage disturbed the economy causing rife unemployment and poverty, and the country was on the cusp of civil unrest. In May 1696 _Charles Montagu_ invited Isaac Newton to the position of Warden of the Mint to help rescue the monetary situation. As Warden of the Mint, Newton was responsible for organising this great recoinage of silver, Newton was Warden from 1696 to 1699 . Newton’s mandate was to ensure the quality & purity of the coinage and to prosecute those who sought to counterfeit and debase it. As Warden of the Mint he represented the interests of The Crown. Whilst Newton’s predecessors had taken no meaningful action, treating the position as a sinecure, Newton characteristically got to work.

The Royal Mint had a peculiar organisational structure, whereby the crown would provide the floor space, and machines, supply the raw material and arrange for the sale of the finished product, however the production process itself was conducted by contractors. Newton’s role as Warden was purely supervisory, and he had a significant legal duty. William Chaloner was a prolific coiner and counterfeiter, who was responsible for a large proportion of the volume of counterfeit coinage. Newton would prowl taverns and coffee houses gathering evidence.

Chaloner was overheard in a tavern by one of Newton’s spies saying he “_would pursue that old Dogg the Warden to the end so long as he lived”._ Newton crusaded against Chaloner, and by early 1699 Newton had brought together over 44 depositions against Chaloner. Meddling with the state of the coin was a capital offence, and on the 22nd March, 1699 Chaloner was hanged.

The volume of counterfeit coinage declined significantly during his brief time in office. He took a multifaceted approach by attacking not just the counterfeiters themselves, but by introducing laws to regulate the supply of the equipment and tools that could be used in counterfeiting. The Great Recoinage highlighted the extent of the counterfeiting problem, Newton estimating that as many as 20% of the coins collected during the great recoinage were counterfeit.

**Bimetallism and the emergence of the gold standard**

The scarcity of silver had led to tax collectors accepting gold guineas at inflated market prices, as high as thirty shillings, far exceeding the coin’s 1670 face value of twenty shillings. The government sought to protect the treasury’s revenues when it accepted gold as taxes, by attempting to put an upper bound on the market the price of the guinea in 1696. The issue was that gold was legal tender, and people could pay their taxes in gold but the face value of these taxes didn’t reflect the market value implying a shortfall in treasury revenue.

On the death of _Thomas Neale_ the incumbent Master of the Mint in 1699, Newton was promoted to Master of the Mint, with the formal duty of overseeing all of the Mint’s expenditures. He also became heavily involved with the discussion about the gold-silver ratio, annually updating the treasury with his thoughts.Newton was looking to define a gold-silver ratio that would solve these issues of coinage, particularly the scarcity of silver coin. This gold-silver ratio would correspond to the mint parity, the rate at which one could convert a certain amount of gold or silver into a particular amount of legal tender. As Master of the mint Newton would have regular correspondence with the treasury on the state of the coin. Newton found that gold coins passed in England for considerably more than its silver value in nearly every other country, although Spain exceptionally overvalued gold even more than the English.

From a 1717 letter addressed to the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury Newton discusses the relative values of gold and silver globally.

_In France a pound weight of fine Gold, is reckon’d worth 15 Pounds weight of fine Silver._

_…._

_In China & Japan one pound weight of fine Gold is worth but 9 or 10 Pounds weight of fine Silver, & in East India it may be worth 12. and this low price of Gold in proportion to Silver carrys away the Silver from all Europe.\`\`_

_…._

Newton explicitly recognised the potential for arbitrage

_“temptation to export or Melt down the Silver Coyn …. the Demand for Exportation arises from the higher price of Silver in other places than in England, in proportion to Gold._

In this same letter Newton recommended a _gold Guinea_ be rated at no more than _21 Shillings_, this corresponds to a gold-silver ratio of fifteen and a half units of silver per unit gold. This recommendation was brought into law by George I in December 1717, the proclamation declaring that gold guineas couldn’t be accepted legally for more than 21 shillings, and smaller and larger coins were to be proportionally affected. Orders were promulgated to tax collectors that they couldn’t accept gold guineas at more than 21 shillings. The change in the value of the guinea from one pound sterling to 21 shilling was a revaluation, not a change to the material specification of the coin; there was the same amount of gold in a 1717 guinea as a 1670 guinea; it was simply rated higher in terms of sterling. The 1670 guinea had been rated at 20 shillings, however this rate didn’t correspond to the rate at which the guineas actually traded, circulating with a market price of 21 shillings and 6 pennies. Whilst a specification for gold coinage was introduced, the definition of silver coinage wasn’t modified.

In 1717 Newton had priced the gold guinea in terms of silver, gold now accompanied silver as a unit of account. Updating the mint parity was a decision not to be taken lightly, the response from the holders of devalued gold coinage was intense, taking to rioting to show their anger. To satisfy the mob a resolution was passed declaring that the value of gold coin wouldn’t be subsequently modified.

Previous changes to the mint parity of gold and silver didn’t materially affect market forces, however this change, actually capping the rate at which gold guineas could be used to pay taxes represented a significant step in monetary policy. The proclamation implied a movement to a bimetallic standard as both gold and silver would circulate as a unit of account, both metals materially defined in sterling. At the beginning of the 18th century, and before, silver had been a sole unit of account.

Following the fixing of the guinea at 21s there was scarcely any silver coined at the Royal Mint for a century, from the time of Newton’s proclamation to the formal end of the bimetallic standard. This implied gold-silver ratio still undervalued silver from the perspective of other nations. The shortage of legitimate coins led to the proliferation of counterfeit coinage. The government had treated control of the coinage as an exclusive right, slowing down the emergence of a legitimate parallel system of tokens, however they largely tolerated counterfeiting, understanding its necessity in the context of excess demand for coinage. The counterfeiters had de facto replaced the government in the supply of low denomination coinage.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*zic-K8q6iOyVWrOP)

The industrial revolution was bringing people into the cities, and into industrial labour, changing the way in which labour was compensated. The increased demand for coinage within Britain had provided the impetus for the emergence of token coinage, where private merchants would create tokens that would be used as a substitute for regal coinage. In 1787 Matthew Boulton was granted an exclusive licence to mint copper coinage for the government. At his Soho Mint famously used a steam-powered press to make his coinage, a private solution dominating the quality of contemporary government coinage, and a low cost owing to his innovative means of production.

Whether or not the collapse of a bimetallic standard is theoretically inevitable doesn’t change the fact that it did. If the shock is small enough arbitrage transactions would equalise world prices and the mint ratio — with the bimetallic country left with a higher proportion of the once depreciated metal in its money supply. However the Chinese demand shocks were massive, with net silver flows into China remaining positive into the 19th century. The demand and supply side factors threw the economy system into such a massive disequilibrium something had to budge.

During the Chinese population boom of the first half of the eighteenth century there was a corresponding increase in demand for the monetary metal to the meet the needs of growing commerce, like the period from 1540 to 1640 the price of silver within China was in excess that of the rest of the world introducing another chance for traders to profit off arbitrage. The West still had a huge trade deficit with China, which was being financed by the export of silver to China. Counterintuitively, the silver trade with China wasn’t entirely attributable to the trade for consumer goods, much of the silver exported to China was shipped by traders seeking to make a profit from moving silver to China and exchanging it for gold that could be used for purchase in Europe.

In 1774 Britain moved to a limping standard, limiting the legal tender value of silver. This prevented the free minting of silver. The Coinage Act of 1816 limited the scope of transactions that one could conduct in silver leaving gold as an unlimited legal tender. Financial and technological innovations had solved the necessity of silver for all transactions. The Coinage Act had England abandon bimetallism in favour of a gold standard with a token-silver coinage.

**The world after this**

The maintenance of a bimetallic standard was an abundantly difficult task, and in the context of global trade, arguably one doomed to fail. After Britain’s decision to embrace the gold standard it set a precedent so that by the end of the 19th century nearly all countries in the world were under a monometallic standard, although China and Mexico retained their silver standard through to the 20th century.

The movement to the gold standard, with silver-token coinage, was the first of many steps in a march of increasingly abstract forms of money. Many countries suspended the convertibility of their gold standard during the first world war, and again during the second world war. The Bretton Woods agreement, made in the wake of the second world war, changed the global monetary standard to a US dollar standard. This dollar standard was linked to a gold standard, dollars redeemable for gold in the USA. In 1965, Charles De Gaulle of France asked to convert its dollar reserves into gold, followed by several other countries. In 1971 Richard Nixon suspended the convertibility of the dollar and severed the tie between money and metal.

The nature of money in trade is important on two levels: money is important for intra-country trade and inter-country trade. Even in the modern world Central Banks hold gold on their balance sheets as it still plays a role in settling international transactions. Russia, China and a number of states slightly at odds with The West have been substituting their American treasury bills for gold perhaps insinuating a return to the past.

The Royal Mint, and mints around the world, once organs of monetary policy live on today in a much more limited capacity creating collectible coinage and coinage as an investment vehicle, rather than being the physical basis for the economy’s primary medium of economic exchange.
