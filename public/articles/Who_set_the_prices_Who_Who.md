# Introduction

In 2000 the British government auctioned off 3G telecom licences. This sale produced over £22 billion in revenue, over 2% of British GDP at the time. The Biggest Auction Ever. Economists heralded it as a great success for the discipline. 

This auction didn't follow a typical English or Dutch Auction format. It was engineered for purpose. It was the Simultaneous Multiple Round Ascending Auction. Taking into account the incentives of this particular group of bidders, telecoms companies, and the government's longer-term social welfare objectives.

Whilst not representing the entire discipline of auction theory, mechanism design or any of a number of names, it's the most high profile example of the use of synthetic markets for a particular end. Synthetic markets are deliberately constructed by policy makers for a specific purpose - in (perhaps superficial!) contrast to the reified market signified when one generically refers to ‘the market’. 

A story of modern economics is story is the metamorphosis of the economist from dismal scientist to heralded social engineer. Although there are various minor-disciplines I'll refer to them as information economics. 

Applied information economics purports to solve social problems in line with market-principles. Through a more abstract lens they can be understood as isomorphic to the command economy. In a command economy planners dictate what should be produced and who should get it. An intellectual battle of the early 20th century between utopian socialist economists and laissez-faire liberals was *the Socialist Calculation Controversy,* hinging around the question of whether a command economy efficiently allocate resources without prices. This question was indispensably epistemic as it got to the heart of what the presence of market prices, and the lack thereof, meant for the efficient allocation of resources. If the existence of price signals is indispensable for the efficient allocation of resources then government economists are interested in the solubility of prices to central treatment. 



# Coase Theorem & Market Design

Coase Theorem emerged as a counterargument to the prevailing view that government regulation was the predominant approach to resolving externalities - externalities referring to the indirect costs of an activity imposed on third-parties, such as pollution generated in manufacturing or noise.

Government regulation, through taxation or the regulation of particular activities can reduce the amount which these activities occur, however the designation of the right amount of pollution is left to the state which with its absence of perfect information is inexorably going to fail. 

Coase paper, The Problem of Social Cost, reframed externalities from being mere undesirables towards a resource conflict.

 Assuming pollution is inextricable from the manufacturing process, it can be understood that the capacity to pollute is one of the necessary factors of manufacturing. The capacity, or right, to pollute a particular amount can be understood in its inverse, the right to not be subject to pollution. 

In the same way that I can negotiate the price of a widget, I should be able to negotiate the amount of pollution that occurs in an area. Coase argument is that the extension of property rights to pollution enables an efficient outcome as in any other domain mediated by the price mechanism. 

The problem of a lot of the earlier Austrian/Chicagoan economic reasoning seems to be the disregard of transaction costs, a core (& explicit) assumption in Coase’ paper. Discussion tends to revolve around the assumption that a monolithic market emerges in response to the transference of property rights, whereas, as we saw in the case of the 3G auction - markets’ microstructure is important: we can run an English Auction, a Dutch Auction, a Vickrey Auction - these auction types are deployed under different circumstances. Ebay uses an English Auction,   Dutch flower markets use a Dutch Auction, Google Ads uses a variation on the Vickrey Auction. 

# Properties of different auctions

The Properties of different auctions 
These different auctions are presumed to have different information properties, how they expose revealed preference. The purpose of the market is, given a range of preferences, to settle on a price 

In the context of an English Auction where there are multiple participants, the person with the highest willingness to spend (which is the proxy for their utility) wins the auction and pays the a marginal amount over the next highest bidder’s maximum willingness to spend - the difference between their maximum willingness to spend and how much they do spend is the consumer surplus. The consumer surplus corresponds to how much someone values something above the price they paid for it. 

In the context of a Dutch Auction where there are multiple participants, the price starts at some high-level presumed to exceed the willingness-to-pay of any individual, and decreases at some rate until a price is found - here there is an incentive to spend according to the value one attributes to an time as if one doesn’t there is the risk someone else purchases it at the lower price. 

In the context of a Vickrey Auction (a type of sealed bid auction), all bidders submit their bids privately - the highest bidder wins but they pay the value of the second highest bid. The incentive is to bid your true price as if you do win there will still be some surplus as the price paid will be the second-highest bidder’s bid. 

The point I'm making by listing out these different auction formats is to make explicit the fact that the structure of a market affects the outcome - markets are not monolithic entities. The result of the bargaining process accrues a surplus, or relatively more value, to some individual.
Market efficiency is often understood in terms of pareto efficiency, i.e. the given allocation of resources could not be modified without making someone else worse off. An allocation is pareto efficient if no further mutual gains are possible, however pareto efficiency doesn’t speak to overall utility or equality. 

At the limit, the most efficient outcomes can only be achieved by dissolving everything with property rights. 

# Market designers aren’t God

If the in the practical/real world an auction is designed by a policy maker to maximise revenues to the treasury without taking into account of the second, third order effects - then this is similar to an arrangement in which an economic planner wants to produce a number of shoes but forgets to specify that shoes be produced a) in pairs, and b) a range of sizes. 
There is an objective: manufacturer 10,000 shoes 

Old dynamic i’ve previously discussed about how you can micro-manage the input or the output. Something needs to be left as a free-variable. The controlled variable is either the input or the output: if you control for a particular output you can’t micro-manage the workers, if you micro-manage the works you can’t control for a particular output. 

There is a fundamental trade-off between autonomy and accountability at the heart of complex social systems. 

Economies are complex systems and command economies and capitalist economies
For command economies the input is controlled at a micro-level, outputs aren’t validated by the market, and shortages / surpluses are common as the system isn’t adapted to real demand. However, even if the output isn’t rewarded in the same way as in capitalist economies - there isn’t the same kind of ecology - at the limit the morale of the people, and the legitimacy of the government represents a lower bound control on output 

For capitalist economies the output is controlled at a micro-level, how a firm delivers an output doesn’t matter as long as the output is there. Obviously inside companies there will be different approaches to delivering an output, at the population-level i.e. the level of many firms, the market doesn’t evaluate firms on the constitution of their approach.
