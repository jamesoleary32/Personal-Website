# The Urbanisation of Virtual Worlds

## Introduction
‘True ownership’ and property rights are oft-referenced by Web3-evangelists as the cornerstone motivation for Web3. Web3 is touted as a system of enforceable property rights for digital assets. There are a couple of major issues with this framing: first property rights are a legal, not a technical, construct and even if one does have ‘true ownership’ how that differs from a mode of faux-ownership inherent to digital assets from the Before Crypto Era (BCE) is rarely usefully elucidated. 

To be clear, I do think that the analogy of property rights does work! Those in Web3 are right to be excited about the idea of digitally-native property rights! Property rights are the transformational event for social organisation. Secure property rights & rule of law are core drivers of economic development and prosperity (a broadly ubiquitous perspective amongst development economists). Web3 provides a foundation for the emergence of a higher order of sophistication in games and virtual worlds. 

My intention with this article is to use ideas from economics, sociology, law and systems theory to argue why and how Web3 represents a huge development for games and virtual worlds.

## Section 1: Social Organisation & Property Rights 

Urbanisation is the movement from agrarian to city-living. From the comparative analysis of agrarian vs city-living emerges a picture of the relationship between property rights and social organisation. 

Let's call agrarian-living, community-living. In a community everyone knows each other (or at least has an idea of each other), everyone knows each other’s reputation: you have the village idiot and the priest, the butcher, the baker etc… In a city it's impossible for everyone to know each other. 

In the community I know who to trust and who not to, in the city I might have some baseline level of trust for people I don’t know but I don't know who people are, their reputation, whether I can trust them as opposed to someone else. If communal trust has a personal-basis, we might say that trust in the city must have an impersonal-basis. We might then dichotomize the community and the city, this opposition is one of the oldest concepts of modern sociology, in German, Gemeinschaft (Community) and Gesellschaft (Society).

This impersonal-basis of trust is the more abstract trust: of institutions, of property rights and the rule of law. If I live in a village I can go to the shop and know whether the shopkeeper is honest or dishonest. In the city I don’t know the shopkeeper but if the city has an inspection body you can trust a regulatory body to ensure honesty. It's much more abstract, and much more scalable. 

At their crux, property relies on recognition and enforcement. How property is recognised and enforced in a community significantly differs from a society. Where property in the community is understood through local customs and relationships, and who you are may matter to the recognition of your ownership. Property in society is defined by the courts and enforced by the police. 

The scale of the city relies on this institution of impersonal property rights. Property is recognised by a broader ‘rule of law’ legal system, if property is stolen or damaged, enforcers (police, military) are obliged to try and  make whole the victim and sanction the culprit. In the knowledge that my rights should be enforced I can be secure in making investments and expect to benefit from any upside; I can go on holiday and expect my house to still be mine when I come back; I can lend my unused items and expect to be paid back. Property rights empower positive-sum coordination.

To recap, property rights facilitate scaling coordination and for mankind property rights mean functional cities. Well, I wonder what the impact of digitally-native property rights are for virtual worlds. 
## Section 2: What Rule of Law Means for Virtual Worlds 
When thinking about property rights and the rule of law in the virtual world, we need to reflect on how law is applied to a virtual world, and what virtual property is. 

Virtual worlds are embedded in the real world, and consequently inherit properties of real-world law. However these virtual worlds are for the most part microcosms of dictatorship and Rule by Law. 

A key reason these virtual worlds look like dictatorships is due to how and why they’re operated. Virtual worlds tend to be maintained by a single entity responsible for infrastructure and content. The provider can have liability for the actions of their users, and insofar that the virtual world inherits the laws of the real world it can be very complex to maintain legal compliance in addition to operating the game. 

The platform provider may be responsible for ensuring the good behaviour of millions of concurrent players, in that context the fewer things the platform has to be responsible for monitoring the more straightforward its compliance. How does it limit its responsibility? In order to play any games, or virtual world, users need to comply with an End-User Licence Agreement, a piece of legal documentation that governs the relationship between the user and the platform provider (for the sake of this article, this can be conflated with the Terms of Use, Terms & Conditions, Terms of Service). 

EULAs are agreements between users and the virtual world operators, between the inhabitants and the government of the virtual world. The limitation of the EULA is that inhabitants have no legal code to rely on for disputes that are purely between each other, they can’t rely on the EULA due to the property of the privity of contract. 

To Recap, EULAs are contracts between the operators of virtual worlds and users. This means that virtual worlds have a different legal framework to the real-world. 
## Section 3: Exploring virtual law: EVE Online, Second Life,  
The legal code of a virtual land is bound up in its EULA & Terms of Services, breaking the legal code comes at risk of temporary or permanent banishment, or even real-world consequences depending on the severity of the transgression.
 
CCP Games, the operator and developer of EVE online, is quite explicit in its legal definition of its users as virtual serfs. 
TERMINATION; SUSPENSION OF ACCOUNT
“A. By CCP for Termination of the Game
CCP may, in its sole discretion, cease to provide any or all of the services offered in connection with EVE (including access to the System and any or all features or components of the Game), terminate the EULA,”
CONDUCT
“B. Selling Items and Objects
You may not transfer, sell or auction, or buy or accept any offer to transfer, sell or auction (or offer to do any of the foregoing), any content appearing within the Game environment,”


These terms make it clear that as a user you have no enduring right to the game world, and trading your in-game items for real money is breaking game law. How could it be breaking the law to sell your own items for real money? Well, even if it's yours to use in the game, those items aren’t yours to trade. You don’t own the items, you have an extremely limited licence to them. The motivation for banning Real Money Trading (RMT) isn’t (typically) nefarious. Real Money Trading means a lot of compliance overhead, and the complexity of distribution goes way up, 

In EVE limited real-world legal rights hasn’t prevented a lot of users creating complex social structures and organisations. The EVE community is so sophisticated that people are even making dedicated HR SaaS for their in-game corporations! They know that CCP Games is incentivised to keep their user base happy and won’t rug everyone for no reason. 
PROPRIETARY RIGHTS
“C. User Content
User Content that you cause to be communicated to the System may not (i) violate any statute, rule, regulation or law; (ii) infringe or violate the intellectual property, proprietary, privacy or publicity rights of any third party
…..
CCP may take any action it deems appropriate regarding any User Content, if CCP believes, in its sole discretion, that such User Content violates the EULA or may expose CCP, its licensors and/or its suppliers to liability”

Even regarding the presumably limited extent to which users can upload outside content to the EVE game world there are strict limitations against what can be posted. The motivation is very clear - people outside of the game can and will come after the operator in the real world due to users’ in-game actions.  

Interestingly, Second Life’s developer Linden Labs takes a slightly different approach to users’ intellectual property: 
Intellectual property
“ 2.3 You grant Linden Lab certain licenses to your User Content.
You retain any and all Intellectual Property Rights you already hold under applicable law in Content you upload, publish, and submit to or through the Servers, Websites, and other areas of the Service,... “

Second Life is positioning their platform to interoperate the real-world of intellectual property law. If users infringe third parties’ rights they will suffer the consequences as they would in the real world but they are specifically empowered to upload to use their own IP. This can give users confidence to develop their digital identity

To recap, the biggest MMOs heavily limit their users’ rights over their items, and are motivated by the need to coexist with the law of the real world, however in spite of this users still form relatively sophisticated virtual communities. In Web2 games, enduring communities are the exception, not the rule. 

## Section 4: Property Rights in Web3 
Blockchain is the cornerstone of digitally native property rights. The importance of blockchain and Web3 for the formation of digital societies is how  blockchain, like rule of law, systematically generates certainty. When a transaction is made the updated state is canon to that blockchain. When a legal decision is made the outcome is established as definitive and binding.  

For a game provider, the power of being able to use blockchain  in an application is that asset-issuance necessarily means the creation of a digital good with a game-independent existence (even if it has limited functionality outside of the game). This digital good is controlled by the user who has an identity independent of individual applications.

EULAs have to be so indemnifying for the virtual world operator. By selling digital goods, if their servers fail or are hacked, those digital goods may become inaccessible or lose their value. The game developer is potentially liable for the losses incurred by their users, hence its critical to mitigate that risk by being very clear that what you're giving your users isn’t property but some kind of limited licence.

On a blockchain network, users' assets are standardised using tokens, and these tokens can be controlled and transferred by the user. On the blockchain, self-custody means that users are responsible for asset-management. A crucial aspect of shifting asset-management from developers to users, is the shifting of liability to the users. This has the dual impact of mitigating developers’ anxieties about their liability and of empowering users. 

The ability to permissionlessly use tokens in various applications means that users can trade, loan, show them in other front-ends and compose their game-items.  

To Recap, blockchain serves a role in the virtual world that is functionally equivalent to the role played by law in the real world. Tokens and self-custody are new, functionally legal, primitives which changes the relationship between the users and the developer. 

## Section 5: Web3 means more sophisticated virtual institutions 
The earlier discussion of the opposition between villages and cities, communities and societies, doesn’t map obviously to the virtual world. For one, virtual worlds have no intrinsic geographic constraints. However like the real-world, virtual worlds are composed of social networks, and coordination is primarily conducted on the basis of reputation rather than on some more impersonal basis 

Recapping on section 1, Institutions are structures of rules and norms that affect behaviour. Property rights and rule of law facilitate the emergence of “impersonal institutions”, which predictably facilitate certain types of behaviour. The parallel between the functional role of Web3 technology in the virtual world and rule of law in the real world suggests that Web3 is the unlock to a similar shift in the scale of coordination. 

Games already facilitate some types of predictable interactions between players, there may be some in-game marketplace or auction house, but these interactions are limited to what the developer has decided to implement, effectively capping the scale of potential coordination. Using the power of composability in a blockchain, users can use their assets outside of a game, in ways neither foreseen nor facilitated by the game developer. 

Consequently users can coordinate together to generate complex outcomes. Whilst not a game, ConstitutionDAO was a great case of this, users sent money to a Smart Contract which would be used to bid for a copy of the US constitution in an auction. Whilst this system still relied on some reputation and trust, the tracking funds and the total amount of finance raised was transparent and contributors were paid back less transaction fees.

I don’t think that this functionality is directly interesting for the median user, as it's only at the margins that the existing mode of virtual ownership shows its limitations. This type of ownership is most likely to be interesting to super-users and the modding community. 

The niche appeal of this functionality doesn’t stand in the way of Web3 having a revolutionary impact. In the real world institutions are typically operated by a smaller group, with the broader community passively benefiting. Tying that to the virtual world, the central institution is the core developer, with supporting institutions being the creators of User-Generated Content and mods. 

Consider the parallel in government operations: just as various public services centrally rely on the ability of the government to collect taxes, in virtual worlds, the core infrastructure and ongoing development rely on the contributions and engagement of all players, and creators can use that infrastructure as a basis for their own activities. Imagine businesses in the real world as modders in the gaming world. These modders depend heavily on the foundational platforms and tools provided by the game developers, much like businesses rely on societal infrastructure.

Within Web2, mod development faces significant challenges and disincentives. Specialised tools may be required for each game, creating a dependency between the modder and the game's primary infrastructure, and if the game servers gets turned off (i.e. the centrally supporting institutions collapse) the utility of the mod likely goes to zero. The composability of Web3 allows some tooling to interoperate across the games on the blockchain, and the more the game’s ontology is on-chain the more enduring the basis of the central institution. Few games have much ontology on-chain,and to explore on-chain modding is something for a separate article.  

To Recap, Smart Contracts facilitate the emergence of virtual institutions. Composability allows users to coordinate in interesting ways outside of the core game. The value of Web3 accrues most directly to modders and creators, those who add the most value to the ecosystem. 

## Conclusion: 
Through this article it should be clear:
Rule of law and property rights have historically been foundational for sophisticated social structures and institutions 
Rule of law doesn’t currently exist in the virtual world (how and why)
Web3 can play a functionally similar role for the virtual world as the rule of law in the real-world.  
Web3 can function as the enabling condition for user-driven institutions in the virtual world

I’m excited to start building with some of the primitives that enable virtual worlds. I'm specifically interested in using MUD and the World Engine for the development of experimental autonomous worlds.
