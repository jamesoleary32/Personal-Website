# Unintended Consequences of Ideas as Things for Science

## Science and the Market

Many of the proposed solutions to problems in modern science converge around a concept known as **Open Science**: the proposition that science is held back by friction — manifest in the peer review process, costly journals, and a cabal of gatekeepers - and if only that friction were mediated somehow scientists would do more science. **DeSci** (Decentralized Science) is an extension of this logic. At face value, it’s a very reasonable suggestion.

However, viewing the organization of science through the lens of friction alone neglects the broader institutional context: **Who is the primary financier? To what end is science directed?** And what are the specific modalities that have shaped science in the 20th and 21st centuries? In this article, I explore the historical context that has led to the assumption that science is soluble to market treatment.

## Where Is the Ideas Marketplace?

The term **“Marketplace of ideas”** is often used in a way that assumes its ubiquity.

The notion may seem intuitive: we understand a marketplace as a nexus of buyers and sellers, and we roughly understand ideas as knowledge or information. Yet a marketplace of ideas, as opposed to a generic marketplace (already a tenuous reification given its many forms), supposes that **ideas can be bought and sold** like widgets, capital machinery, or even midpack weed.

The market is ostensibly the best tool for allocating resources; hence, a marketplace is thought to be the best substrate for allocating ideas. It appears we already have a marketplace of ideas: consider **JSTOR**, the paywalled **New York Times**, or books you can buy on **Amazon**. Indeed, *these* are marketplaces **for** ideas that already exist, not necessarily a market that spontaneously generates *new* ideas.

Advocates of Open Science or DeSci suggest that further **marketization** of scientific production is beneficial. On the surface, this is intuitive: the assignment of property rights can clarify incentives. However, the essence of science does not always align with the essence of the market. Markets can act as an **epistemic leveler**, whereas science often demands **epistemic diversity**. A “marketplace of ideas” may thus be **procrustean** when applied too rigidly to scientific inquiry.

### Setting Up the Next Section

To contextualize this discussion, I’ll explore how the notion that science can be treated as a market commodity has penetrated research practices, where this might be effective, and where it could have drawbacks.

I do not aim to prescribe solutions here but rather to place the **contemporary science regime** in its historical and institutional context, highlighting some limitations of a naïve extension of commercialization. This suggests potential **epistemic constraints** in the popular market-driven model of science—namely, that a push for maximal market penetration can obscure deeper structural realities.

## The Current State of Science

Abstractly, there are three main roles in science:
1. **Those who finance science**  
2. **Those who do science**  
3. **Those who decide what becomes consensus**

This value chain has taken several heterogeneous forms—for example:
- **Chandlerian M-form corporations** with internal R&D capabilities  
- The **Cold War regime**, where government was the primary financier of R&D  
- The **contemporary globalized privatization regime**

This value chain takes a number of heterogeneous forms, such as the regime of Chandlerian M-form corporations with internal R&D capabilities, the cold-war regime where the government became the primary financier of R&D and the contemporary globalised privatisation regime. 

Given that - to assume that scientists doing science is some black box, and that scientists just follow the money but are otherwise doing the same thing, seems like too much of an easy story. 

In each of these historical regimes ‘science’ beyond its reification is a meshwork of institutions where money shapes the organisation of science and the quality (meant neutrally) of its outputs, not just scientific direction.

## Issues Within Science

Various structural issues in science have material consequences:

- **Replication Crisis**: Many published studies fail to replicate when their methodology is independently repeated.  
- **Publication Bias**: A tendency to publish positive, statistically significant results over null or negative findings.  
- **Funding Gaps**: Certain areas (e.g., rare diseases) are considered unprofitable by major funders like big Pharma, which often sets a \$1bn/year revenue threshold to justify investment.

Given these demonstrable issues, it’s easy to see why many argue that science needs **comprehensive restructuring**.

## What Is DeSci, Open Science?

More recently, **DeSci** (Decentralized Science) has emerged as part of this “marketplace of ideas” approach to fix the issues plaguing research. DeSci is **genealogically connected** to Open Science, emphasizing **disintermediation** of traditional gatekeepers and the creation of new funding mechanisms.

At its center is the belief that the current financing structure creates many of the known problems in science. The argument goes: if we had better funding mechanisms—ones that **democratize** science or incentivize it via **market logic**—we could solve these problems.

A core tenet of the crypto world is disintermediation: removing intermediaries to make processes faster, cheaper, and more transparent. For instance, **BioDAOs** have emerged as decentralized communities pooling resources (often through token sales) to fund and manage biotech research. Proponents argue that such tokens can align incentives in ways traditional systems cannot.

Essentially, **DeSci** seeks to wrap the organization of science with **crypto-incentives** (i.e., market incentives) under the assumption that tokenization is the best primitive for extending property rights to new arenas.

## The Marketplace, Information, and Ideas

Markets rely on the existence of property rights: anything that can be wrapped with property rights can be subject to the eminent wisdom of the market! IP is a way to make ideas market soluble. 

And a marketplace is composed of a demand-side and a supply-side, if we produce a situation in which both the right people get the right ideas and the right people are induced to supply those ideas to market then we reduce market failures

For sure we can sell information, we can sell IP, but it's not obvious that the limiting factor on research is access to IP. Would Los Alamos, Bell Labs have been more efficient if they just had jstor or research gate (well the public/private relationship in the case of Los Alamos is not as clear cut as you might think). 

Is it really that counterintuitive to apply the market treatment to the production of ideas? Software is abstract, software can be bought and sold, creating software is understood as a project as opposed to being amenable to mechanised end-2-end, perhaps I’m speaking too late given Devin etc…  Crucially I am interested in how ideas have been reified, and its implications

## The Neoclassical Intrusion Into Ideas-Space

Where does the notion that ideas are amenable to goods-like treatment come from?
In my undergraduate economics degree I learnt about the **Romer model**, or the endogenous growth model , which, in combination with the **Solow model** (the exogenous growth model), is foundational growth economics. The Solow Model (1956) is a famed model of long-run economic growth Explain more?

The **Solow residual** is the observation that most GDP growth cannot be explained by changes in the economy’s capital stock, GDP growth must be explained by improving productivity - innovation is putatively the basis of productivity improvements. 

Essentially the Romer model is the extension of the neoclassical production function to productivity growth, where productivity growth is conflated with innovation, which begetes some capacious ontological entity we might call technoscience. The essence of the model being that we should expect increasing returns to scale given that:
- knowledge begets more knowledge 
- knowledge begets productivity increases 
- more productivity means we can allocate more resources to generating more knowledge. 

If we think about Ronald Coase and his theory of the firm, asking why are firms more than just a nexus of contracts and instead have internal hierarchies the boundaries of which are dictated by (dis)economies of scale and market transaction costs. 

The treatment of knowledge, ideas as goods made them amenable to the neoclassical production function! Now we can produce science like we would widgets, maybe gadgets are the intermediate step lol.

## Bioethicists for Hire?

To see how **market logic** can alter the fabric of research, consider the rise of **Contract Research Organizations (CROs)** and the evolving role of **Academic Health Centers (AHCs)**:

- **Big Pharma** has outsourced clinical trials to AHCs for decades.  
- CROs enable end-to-end outsourcing of trials, partly to reduce costs and streamline data collection for FDA protocols.

Why use a **freestanding commercial entity** rather than in-house capacity? This shift reflects the **commercialization of scientific research** absent a direct product line in-house. Yet it also illustrates the **limits** of scientific marketization:

1. **Clinical trials aren’t truly fungible.**  
2. CROs were created to lower conventional trial costs and optimize standardized data collection.  
3. Pharmaceutical firms seek predictable outcomes aligned with **regulatory requirements** (e.g., FDA), but this may not always align with broader scientific explorations or public-health priorities.

Such outsourcing invites questions about the **objectives** of big Pharma, the potential conflicts of interest, and whether purely market-based logic can inadvertently stifle more **exploratory** or **diverse** scientific inquiry.

## Conclusion

**DeSci** is compelling, particularly for **alternative funding** and addressing certain **market failures** within science. However, it’s not the **silver bullet** its biggest advocates often claim. Real-world issues—such as replication crises, publication bias, and systemic funding gaps—might simply replay under new organizational models that follow the same **market logic**.
